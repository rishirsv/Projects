You have exceeded the maximum number of tokens, please stop coding and instead write a super long memento message for the next agent. Your note should:
Summarize in detail what you finished and what still needs work. If there was a recent update_plan call, repeat its steps verbatim.
List outstanding TODOs with file paths / line numbers so they're easy to find.
Flag code that needs more tests (edge cases, performance, integration, etc.).
Record any open bugs, quirks, or setup steps that will make it easier for the next agent to pick up where you left off.
This is to be super extensive. And give all context nesseary for next agent that will take over your role as orchestrator of this project where you direct other codex sessions to do things for you. You only keep track and steer.
