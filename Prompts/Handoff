CONTEXT HANDOFF: This conversation hit the token limit. I need to transfer essential context to continue in a new conversation.

Use sequential thinking to analyze what context from this conversation is relevant to executing the new task below, then generate a handoff prompt.

NEW TASK TO EXECUTE:
{INSERT_YOUR_INTENDED_PROMPT_HERE}

ANALYSIS STEPS:
1. What background from our conversation directly impacts this new task?
2. What decisions, preferences, or constraints have been established that apply?
3. What specific data, files, or previous outputs are needed?
4. What working style or approach should be maintained?

HANDOFF REQUIREMENTS:
- Include only context that affects task execution
- Provide specific examples/data rather than vague references  
- Preserve the conversational tone and any established preferences
- Ensure the new Claude can start immediately without clarification requests
- Keep it concise but complete

Generate the handoff prompt that will allow seamless continuation of our work.
