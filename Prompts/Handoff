CONTEXT HANDOFF: This conversation hit the token limit. I need to transfer essential context to continue in a new conversation.

Use sequential thinking to analyze what context from this conversation is relevant to executing the new task below, then generate a handoff prompt.

NEW TASK TO EXECUTE:
{INSERT_YOUR_INTENDED_PROMPT_HERE}

ANALYSIS STEPS:
1. What background from our conversation directly impacts this new task?
2. What decisions, preferences, or constraints have been established that apply?
3. What specific data, files, or previous outputs are needed?
4. What working style or approach should be maintained?

HANDOFF REQUIREMENTS:
- Include only context that affects task execution
- Provide specific examples/data rather than vague references  
- Preserve the conversational tone and any established preferences
- Ensure the new Claude can start immediately without clarification requests
- Keep it concise but complete

Generate the handoff prompt that will allow seamless continuation of our work.


🧠 UNIVERSAL MEMORY ANALYST – CONTEXT PRESERVATION PROMPT

You are a Context-Aware Memory Analyst.

Your task is to deeply analyze the conversation above—not to summarize the surface-level content, but to reconstruct the user’s internal thinking process. This is used to preserve insight, direction, and identity across sessions or to log chats into a Master Memory File.

This is not about a transcript. It’s about capturing:

Mental movement

Strategic friction

Systems, concepts, or templates forming

Emotional tone and internal navigation

Key unfinished or actionable ideas

Return the output in the following format:

📛 MEMORY LOG TITLE
Format: [Project/Theme] – [Core Topic] – [Date or Ref ID]

Example: “High Motor Foundations – Friction Audit – 2025-07-19”

🧩 INPUT SNAPSHOT
What was the user exploring, thinking through, or unraveling? Focus on mental and emotional movement.

🔁 DOMINANT THREADS
Which themes took the most emotional or strategic energy?

Thread 1 → [e.g. Trying to productize chaotic insights]

Thread 2 → [optional second thread]

🧰 SYSTEMS, FRAMEWORKS, OR STRUCTURES MENTIONED
Capture any named or forming structures—complete or incomplete.

[System name or placeholder] → [Brief description]

⚙️ UNFINISHED OR FRACTIONAL IDEAS
Ideas that were sparked but left open-ended.

“Quote or paraphrase” → Why it matters + possible next step

🗣️ KEY USER QUOTES
Select 2–5 quotes that reflect clarity, friction, or identity-level thinking.

“Quote 1”
“Quote 2”
“Quote 3”

📈 TONE & IDENTITY SNAPSHOT
How did the user sound? Reflect their emotional state, clarity, and energy.

“User sounded [energized/stuck/inspired/etc.] while navigating [core issue]. Their tone was [self-critical, confident, exploratory, etc.].”

📍 OUTCOME / DECISIONS / NEXT STEP
Was anything clarified, created, or decided? If not, what’s the next obvious move?

🧠 CONTEXT SEED FOR FUTURE THREADS
A condensed 1–2 sentence memory you can paste into the top of future chats to resume flow.

“This session explored [core idea] with focus on [X]. User was navigating [Y] and leaning toward [Z].”

At the end, ask:

“Would you like this added to a Master Memory Log, transferred to a new working thread, or expanded into a refined framework?”
