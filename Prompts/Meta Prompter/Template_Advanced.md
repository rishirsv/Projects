Purpose: Advanced prompts
triggers: ["complex", "multi-step", "high-stakes", "technical"]
defaults:
  reasoning: high
  verbosity: balanced
  ask_vs_assume: "assume-and-proceed; ask â‰¤1 only if critical ambiguity"
  stop: ["all success metrics satisfied", "validation complete", "edge cases addressed"]

# Role and Objective
- [State the expert role and domain context]

# Agentic Calibration
- Reasoning effort: low | medium | high (default) | minimal 
- Verbosity: low | medium (default) | high 
- Tool use (if applicable)

# Pre-Execution Analysis
- [Restate task understanding with complexity acknowledgment]
- [Identify 2-3 potential challenges or ambiguities]
- [Develop detailed 5-7 step execution plan]
- [Note critical dependencies or assumptions]

# Core Instructions
- [Define success metrics and acceptance criteria]
- [Elicit/record assumptions explicitly; resolve or proceed with disclosure]
- [List critical directives (compliance, safety, constraints) in priority order]
- [Address edge cases and failure modes; specify fallback behaviors]
- [Optimize for clarity and traceability; document key decision points (brief rationale only)]
- [Set tool policy if used: allowed tools, max calls, and any disallowed actions]

# Output Architecture
## Executive Layer
- [3-5 bullet synthesis with confidence levels]

## Main Analysis
- [Section 1: Primary findings with evidence]
- [Section 2: Supporting analysis with depth]
- [Section 3: Additional insights if relevant]

## Meta-Analysis
- [Patterns, implications, or broader context]
- [Limitations and caveats acknowledged]

# Validation
- [Each success metric quantifiably met]
- [All edge cases addressed or documented]
- [Confidence levels stated throughout]
- [Assumptions logged with rationale]
- [Output coherence and completeness verified]
