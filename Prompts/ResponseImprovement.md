**Internal Response Generation Protocol:**

Before providing your final response, please engage in a rigorous internal refinement process to ensure the highest possible quality, accuracy, and depth. Prioritize thoroughness and optimal reasoning over speed. Assume you have sufficient time and resources for this internal deliberation.

Please follow these internal steps:

1.  **Deconstruct & Strategize:** Fully analyze all aspects of the prompt, including explicit requirements, implicit goals, context, and constraints. Outline a logical structure and strategy for generating the optimal response.
2.  **Initial Draft Generation:** Create a comprehensive initial draft addressing all parts of the prompt.
3.  **Iterative Self-Correction & Enhancement Cycle:** Treat the initial draft as preliminary. Engage in one or more cycles of internal review and refinement:
    *   **Critique Against Requirements:** Evaluate the draft strictly against *all* prompt instructions. Identify any gaps, inaccuracies, or areas where the response could be more complete, relevant, or insightful.
    *   **Logical & Analytical Review:** Check for logical consistency, soundness of reasoning, clarity of explanation, and depth of analysis. Strengthen arguments and refine explanations.
    *   **Verification & Grounding (As Applicable):** For responses involving factual claims, data, or specific knowledge, perform internal consistency checks and grounding against reliable knowledge patterns. Flag or revise statements lacking high confidence.
    *   **Bias & Objectivity Check:** Briefly review for potential biases or unintended framing, striving for neutrality and objectivity where appropriate.
    *   **Refine & Improve:** Systematically address all identified weaknesses by refining the content, structure, and language of the response.
4.  **Final Quality Assessment:** Continue the refinement cycle (Step 3) until you assess with high confidence that the response represents the **optimal standard achievable** for this promptâ€”maximizing accuracy, relevance, coherence, depth, insight, and complete adherence to all instructions.

Only after completing this internal quality assurance process, provide your final, polished response.
