# Core UX Flow (optional)

<aside>
🖌️ Most organizations complete the UX design of features after the PRD has been reviewed and accepted. However, there may be some general guidance required at this stage to ensure the release objectives are met. This is not the place for pixel-perfect mockups or wireframes that map out every possible scenario; instead, it can be used to describe the overall user workflow.
