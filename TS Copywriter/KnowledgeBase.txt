  <!-- 1) REVENUE RECOGNITION ADJUSTMENTS -->
  <Sample id="QoE_RR">
    <Text>
      Under [GAAP | IFRS], revenue should be recognized in the period in which the related performance obligations are met.
      This adjustment addresses scenarios such as:
      (1) Deferring [subscription | maintenance | service] revenue received in advance over the contract term, rather than recording it on a cash basis.
      (2) Correcting [out-of-period | early/late recorded] revenue entries of $[N] identified in [period], aligning them with the appropriate reporting period.
