  <!-- 1) REVENUE RECOGNITION ADJUSTMENTS -->
  <Sample id="QoE_RR">
    <Text>
      Under [GAAP | IFRS], revenue should be recognized in the period in which the related performance obligations are met.
      This adjustment addresses scenarios such as:
      (1) Deferring [subscription | maintenance | service] revenue received in advance over the contract term, rather than recording it on a cash basis.
      (2) Correcting [out-of-period | early/late recorded] revenue entries of $[N] identified in [period], aligning them with the appropriate reporting period.
      These changes ensure that revenue is recognized consistently with [contract terms | industry standards] and reflect [ongoing/recurring] operations in EBITDA.

  <!-- 2) NONRECURRING ITEMS (EXPENSES/INCOME) -->
  <Sample id="QoE_Nonrec">
    <Text>
      Nonrecurring items include [one-time expenses | gains] that do not reflect Target’s ongoing operations. Examples:
      • Transaction costs (legal, advisory, travel) incurred for [deal/transaction] in [period] of $[N].
      • Severance of $[N] paid to [N] employees in [MMM-YY].
      • One-time insurance claim proceeds of $[N] in [MMM-YY].
      • Charitable donations of $[N] that Management deems unlikely to recur post-close.
      These amounts are excluded from EBITDA to present a normalized view of Target’s earnings.

  <!-- 3) COMPENSATION & BONUS NORMALIZATION -->
  <Sample id="QoE_Comp">
    <Text>
      Target’s compensation adjustments address both [discretionary | performance-based] bonuses and related payroll taxes. 
      (1) Discretionary bonuses of $[N], paid in [MMM-YY], are considered one-time and excluded from EBITDA. 
      (2) Ongoing bonuses accrue [monthly | quarterly] based on performance metrics, requiring a normalization of $[N] to align accruals with actual payouts. 
      (3) Associated payroll taxes are accrued at the same time, reflecting the ratable expense in the appropriate period.

  <!-- 4) CAPITALIZATION VS. EXPENSING -->
  <Sample id="QoE_CapExp">
    <Text>
      Certain costs, such as [R&D | software development | marketing] expenditures, may qualify for capitalization under [US GAAP | IFRS] if they meet specified criteria. 
      (1) In [period], Target capitalized $[N] of [project] costs that were previously expensed. 
      (2) Alternatively, upon review, $[N] of [internal labor | R&D spend] was reclassified to an operating expense as it did not meet capitalization thresholds. 
      These adjustments align EBITDA with [industry-standard | GAAP] practices and clarify whether costs are ongoing operating expenses or capitalizable expenditures.

  <!-- 5) RESERVES & IMPAIRMENTS -->
  <Sample id="QoE_Reserves">
    <Text>
      This adjustment addresses Target’s [bad debt | inventory | intangible asset] reserves and impairments: 
      (1) An allowance for doubtful accounts increased by $[N] to reflect historical write-off rates of [N]% of revenue. 
      (2) An impairment charge of $[N] was recorded in [period] for [assets] whose expected future cash flows were insufficient. 
      Excluding or adjusting these amounts normalizes EBITDA for [period(s)] to capture Target’s ongoing earnings capacity.

      Target’s revenues and expenses may be denominated in [foreign currencies], leading to exchange rate fluctuations. 
      This adjustment restates revenue and costs at a [constant exchange rate | average rate], isolating operational performance from currency volatility. 
      For instance, remeasuring [revenues/costs] at $[N]/[currency] in [period] results in a $[N] impact on EBITDA. 
      This approach provides a clearer comparison across reporting periods.

  <!-- 2) Monthly/Quarterly Variances -->
  <Sample id="NWC_Trends">
    <Text>
      Certain adjustments have no impact on year-end balances but affect monthly or quarterly NWC trends. For instance, $[N] of [receivables | accruals] reversed in [period] did not appear in the year-end trial balance but altered interim NWC metrics.

  <!-- 3) Standard Cash-Free, Debt-Free Exclusions -->
  <Sample id="NWC_StandardExclusions">
    <Text>
      Standard exclusions reflect the [cash-free | debt-free] transaction structure. As of [MMM-YY], we excluded $[N] of [restricted cash | short-term investments | current maturities of debt] from NWC, classifying these amounts as either cash or indebtedness outside of NWC calculations.

  <!-- 4) Non-Operational / One-Time Items -->
  <Sample id="NWC_NonOperationalItems">
    <Text>
      This adjustment removes $[N] of [non-operational | one-time] liabilities or assets that will not continue post-close. Items such as [accrued transaction fees | settlement payables | management fees] are excluded from NWC to reflect recurring operational balances.
    </Text>
    <Keywords>NWC; non-operational; one-time liabilities; post-close; management fees</Keywords>

  <!-- 5) Bonus Accruals as Indebtedness -->
  <Sample id="NWC_BonusAccruals">
    <Text>
      Target accrues bonuses on a [monthly | quarterly] basis. At [period-end], $[N] of discretionary or prior-period bonus accruals remained unpaid. We reclassified this amount as indebtedness rather than NWC, aligning with the cash-free, debt-free framework.

    <Keywords>NWC; bonus accrual; indebtedness; discretionary bonus; cash-free</Keywords>
  </Sample>

  <!-- 6) Related-Party Balances -->
  <Sample id="NWC_RelatedParty">
    <Text>
      Related-party balances totaling $[N] in [accounts receivable | accounts payable] are excluded from NWC. Since these transactions are non-operational or expected to settle before close, they are adjusted outside the core NWC calculation.

    <Keywords>NWC; related party; non-operational; AR/AP; settlement</Keywords>
  </Sample>

  <!-- 7) Deferred Rent -->
  <Sample id="NWC_DeferredRent">
    <Text>
      Deferred rent of $[N] is a non-cash liability that is typically addressed through purchase accounting at close. Consequently, we removed the deferred rent balance from NWC, presenting only near-term cash obligations.
    </Text>
    <Keywords>NWC; deferred rent; non-cash liability; purchase accounting; exclusion</Keywords>
  </Sample>

  <!-- 8) CAPEX & Long-Term Items -->
  <Sample id="NWC_CAPEX">
    <Text>
      Accrued liabilities for capital expenditures, such as $[N] in [CAPEX vendor payables], are excluded from NWC. These costs reflect long-term investments rather than routine operational outflows.
    </Text>
    <Keywords>NWC; CAPEX; accrued liabilities; non-operational; exclusion</Keywords>
  </Sample>

  <!-- 9) Out-of-Period / Misclassified Entries -->
  <Sample id="NWC_OutOfPeriod">
    <Text>
      Our analysis identified $[N] of out-of-period or misclassified entries in [AP | AR | accruals], recorded in the incorrect reporting window. We allocated these amounts to the proper period, reducing NWC by $[N] to align the balance with actual transaction dates.
    </Text>
    <Keywords>NWC; out-of-period; misclassification; AP/AR; period alignment</Keywords>
  </Sample>

  <!-- 10) QoE-Linked Adjustments -->
  <Sample id="NWC_QoE_Link">
    <Text>
      We considered whether any Quality of Earnings (QoE) adjustments, such as revenue deferrals or expense reclassifications, also impacted NWC. For instance, $[N] of deferred subscription revenue shifted from accounts receivable to unearned revenue, reducing NWC at [period-end].
    </Text>

  </Sample>

  <!-- 11) Classification & Presentation -->
  <Sample id="NWC_Classification">
    <Text>
      Current assets and liabilities were presented based on Management’s definitions and GAAP. We adjusted $[N] related to [inventory reclass | accrual timing] to align with typical NWC conventions, reflecting operational balances for the closing date.
    </Text>
    <Keywords>NWC; classification; GAAP; inventory reclass; accrual timing</Keywords>
  </Sample>

  <!-- 12) Key Drivers & Fluctuations -->
  <Sample id="NWC_Fluctuations">
    <Text>
      Net working capital fluctuated due to seasonal revenue cycles and timing differences in billing or expense accruals. For instance, a spike in [inventory | receivables] during [MMM-YY] raised NWC by $[N] before normalizing the following month.
    </Text>

  </Sample>

  <!-- 13) Long-Term Trend Observations -->
  <Sample id="NWC_LongTermTrend">
    <Text>
      Over the historical period, NWC [increased/decreased] by $[N], driven by changes in [payables terms | credit policy | business seasonality]. Adjustments for non-operational items reduced these fluctuations, isolating the operational baseline of current assets and liabilities.
