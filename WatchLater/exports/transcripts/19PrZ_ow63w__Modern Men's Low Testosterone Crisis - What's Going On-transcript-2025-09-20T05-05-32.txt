We hear that male testosterone levels have dropped on average since like the 70s or something like that. First of all, is that true? Yeah. So, there is some truth to that. And the reason is because we know that as people get more unhealthy, they get more comorbid conditions, more diabetes, more high blood pressure, more um you know uh high cholesterol. All of these things are basically going up and testosterone subsequently is going down. So the more you acquire these things, the more obesity, the more metabolic syndrome, the more we're seeing testosterone go down and even in younger people because they're also unhealthy, legendarily so, right? And so that's the number one reason. There's also a whole host of other things that contribute. We are having more exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals in the environment. Um, and some of which we do have legislation to control like there's no micro beads in and micro micro bead sort of products anymore that are available in the United States. BPA free is a very common thing. So there are things in place to try to limit exposures, but we're eating like what a credit card of plastic every year or something. I make sure to eat a real credit card every year just not to miss out. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Um, so you know, I mean, I think there are exposures that we can sort of limit, but to some degree we're all exposed and the good news is that we can get rid of a lot of it, but at some point it does accumulate, right? And so that's causing issues. Um, and so yeah, all those things together and then, you know, when when you're thinking about things that boost testosterone, it's like movement, right? It's it's moving your body, lifting weights, doing, you know, high-intensity interval training and like we are more and more sedentary, right? We're doing Zoom meetings at home, like we're sitting on our couches and like since COVID and so I think that's playing a big role in it. Yeah. And we're more stressed out than ever, right? People are just so stressed like chronic levels of stress and if you have chronic chronically elevated cortisol, it's going to affect your testosterone. That's a big deal. That also ends up affecting sexual behavior tremendously because I think stress is like the great killer of sex life pretty much. Absolutely. I mean, you can't get turned on when you're when you're like stressed. Yeah. It's like just now's not the time. Yeah. Exactly. Just imagine like you've got like a like a machine gun up and there's zombies down range and the girl next to you is like, "Let's get it on." You're like, "Are you crazy? There's a time and place for this young lady." Yes. Yeah. And so if you low-key always have stress, you low-key have will have lower testosterone probably and probably like less fruitful and regenerative sexual interactions that are just healthy for humans to have. Right. Right. And it's sort of like a a self-fulfilling prophecy like your testosterone goes up when you have anticipation for sex. Yes. And so if you don't have anticipation for sex because you're stressed all the time, that also plays a role, right? And then, you know, I think the other big one is sleep. So we don't sleep. We are scrolling our phones until whatever hour of night or we're purposely staying up late because life is so stressful and we want this downtime, but then we're hurting ourselves. That's a big one. people will have these really ambitious I mean to make this not so negative and like balanced humans are accomplishing more than ever absolutely our incomes are staggering relative to uh our ability to buy things absolutely staggering so we're just hyper successful but we're so successful that we end up working so much and getting so stressed and we end up having like an half an hour at the end of every day to be like well just you time now and you're like I don't need half an hour I need 3 hours and then you're missing And that whole thing of stress is going on and you don't have time to connect with your partner because everyone's working like a dog. Like we wanted this. Um, one thing I like to tell people is like economically almost every American, not every, but almost every can afford to work like half as much and still have a great standard of living. When you're like, "Hey, do you want to work half as much and have half less money?" You're like most people are just like, "No, I'm I want money. I'm good." Consumerism is like a real thing, right? So you got to keep up with the Joneses in order to keep your lifestyle. you got to keep working and um you know I think that's a real problem right because we like we also have now because of modern technology the ability to work like from our phones everywhere like you can literally be constantly working if you so choose to every time I'm on a flight to go somewhere usually for work I end up looking at my phone like here for 3 hours might as well get to work and I just end up working I think a lot of people end up doing that yeah that's that's a big deal um all right let's uh talk about the elephant in the room I'm kidding I don't that's a a shit analogy. Um that's funnier when I say it. People have lower sperm counts as well. Males have lower sperm counts. Correct. There have been many hypothesis as to why that is. Part of it's testosterone mediated, part of it is no doubt endocrine chemical to some limited or moderate extent, but it's not the whole picture. We know that. Yeah. But what about ejaculation frequency mediated by pornography? Because this is a story I've heard. Folks are jerking it a lot. And what that does is it lowers the accumulation of higher testosterone through the week, for example, because it's kind of an off valve. It also reduces sperm count and keeps your sperm count lower. And uh maybe it also, and this is speculative, I'd love for you to uh touch on this, somehow kind of deflates your deep drive and motivation for success or something like that. People are kind of fuzzy about that might reduce athletic performance. It just kind of takes the oomph out of your sales. How much of that is true? Is it true only at the extremes? Does it affect everyone? What is your take on that? Well, let's talk about the stuff that we absolutely know. So what we absolutely know is that when you are ejaculating frequently, your sperm concentration and count is going to be lower, right? And so we've they've actually done multiple studies to figure out like how often should you ejaculate if you want to get pregnant, right? So that's that there's an abundance of data on that. And they've had people abstain for days and days and days versus, you know, 24 hours. And they found that really yes your sperm count goes up over days but at about 5 days the sperm actually becomes has more DNA fragmentation and becomes genetically less favorable. And so you want sperm. Yes. So you don't really want that kind of sperm when you're trying to have a baby. So what we tell people at least in terms of like keeping healthy sperm is 24 to 48 hours. So you should have sex maybe every other day or every day during your fertile window. Um but that's sufficient. You don't need to do more than that and you don't need to do, you know, you don't need to go wait five days, right? Because you want to essentially have the best chance for sex to have a conception. So, that's one. So, two, then talking about like how does it affect um testosterone? Well, there's actually no data. Um there's only like one study that looked at guys who abstained and it was like 10 guys and they abstained for 21 days. And so, they looked at testosterone levels. They were all lying. Yeah. Well, I mean, whatever. Who knows? But by the 21st day, they checked their testosterone again and it was higher by about 50 nanogs per deciliter now. Oh, that's nothing. It's nothing, right? That could be like a regular day. That's within the margin of error. Yeah. And so, and and then also you could say like it's there's the anticipatory cue. Like if you really abstained for 21 days, like you're really excited. So that's going to play a role as well. So really it was 10 healthy guys with no real medical problems who did this. And like it's not enough to to make any sort of sort of finding with that. There was one other study with like 30 patients and that was actually debunked and like pulled from the literature. So like still people are like looking at that study and it's like there was actually a retraction of that study. Um so ultimately there's really no evidence that ejaculating more frequently or abstaining for like no nut November for example or whatever semen retention my next talking point of my is really going to make a difference in terms of like you getting your testosterone higher. Now in so that's one thing. Now, in terms of like you said like your mood or you're feeling a little less desire or urge for sex. Now, I think that's a whole host of different things. So, why are you masturbating so frequently and using whatever means to do that? Whether it's pornography or or whatever, why why toaster? Think about that. Yeah. Okay. Don't you kink shame me. I You're right. You're right. That's if that's what you're into. Just don't put your app offendage in there. Okay. Oh, that's exactly what it's for. It's safe. I think I used to be an electrician. Anyway, please answer the question. Anyway, so so the question is then why are you doing that? Usually what happens in people who are masturbating quite frequently. What is quite frequently? Can you tell us? I guess it's really quite frequently to the point where it's detracting from their life, right? For some people masturbating once a month is detract is, you know, distracting to them. They feel a lot of shame or guilt or whatever. And then there's some people who they can masturbate every day and they're fine. It doesn't cause any problems. They're having healthy relationships. They're going to work. They're doing all their normal stuff and they're fine. An evening wink basically, right? And some people they're doing it like five, six times a day. And that's, you know, that is causing a problem cuz they're like now not working and they're not doing other things, right? And so it's really subjective how much is too much. But in some people like why are they doing that, right? Are they doing it because they're looking for pleasure? Are they doing it because they're bored? Are they doing it because they're depressed and they're looking for a dopamine hit? Right? And so you could substitute porn for or masturbation for anything, right? Like it could be like you're overeating, you're um you know, you're spending money compulsively shopping, right? So like it's really you're using that particular activity uh to either cure boredom or to deal with shame or distress or sadness or whatever emotionally negative feeling. So the genesis really matters. Correct. And so in those cases, it's really not the act itself, it's what's driving the act. And so that then obviously you're not going to be happy and looking for like joy in life because you're the reason you're doing this is because you're sad or you're bored or whatever. But that sad bored thing started first what you're saying. It's not like you get into porn and all of a sudden you're like this is my only reason for being and it just takes over. I'm sure that happens to some folks. A vast minority as far as I saw in the literature. Yeah. I mean it's like 3% maybe like as it's probably higher now. I mean the literature is a little bit older but I think like the reality is that most people are using it for some purpose right and then they find that that's where they keep going for their joy and it's not and then they feel shame and they feel guilt and they have this moral inongruence with what they're doing like oh this is bad this is shameful and now they feel really bad and then to not feel bad they do it again. Whoa. Yeah, Scott that w last one hit me bro. That's like last Tuesday for me. The tears as lubricant also. No, I'm kidding. Um, okay. Interesting. So, if I say I want to do No Nut November. And for me, that's just like a fun thing, fun way to challenge myself, no harm, no foul. Absolutely not. No. But if I'm doing No Nut November and I'm going to be like, "This is going to reinvigorate my core masculinity and realign me with ancestral principles," I'm probably not going to see that. You know, I think some guys feel that it does though because they just feel this like now they're not focused on whatever the trigger was, right? They found some other way to cope with that trigger and they're not focused on this strong desire to like go masturbate. And so now like, oh, I have all this clarity. I feel so great. I'm like focused on real life and I'm having real connection with people and I'm not just thinking about masturbating. And so like they finally feel this clarity because they really did have sort of an issue, right? they were using it a lot and they were using it as a as a dependence almost and now they feel clarity and so I I say you know what if you do feel that way that's great but that doesn't mean that that's going to apply to every single person and what happens is a lot of people end up doing it because they feel like oh this is good for me I need to do this and they're they're they're like miserable they're like clenching their pelvic floor and they're like they're so stressed and then they have a nighttime emission or a wet dream and they're like and like oh my god I failed I'm a horrible person wow they take it like that finally a wet or they get shamed if they're in a community where they're like, "Oh, this happened to me." Like, "Oh, how could you? You failed now. You failed the challenge and you're not as much of a man or you know, whatever." Right? And so, that's what I take issue with. I don't take issue with anyone feeling good about what they're doing. Great. Keep doing it. But like, don't push those values on people who don't necessarily need that or may not perceive that benefit. Sure. So, november totally optional. If it's something that empowers you and distresses you and allows you to focus on the rest of life, amazing. If you try it and you realize that the thing that was letting you focus on the rest of life was getting off because if you don't get off, you're just constantly staring at titties instead of doing your job, then it's time to unccork and then go back to work. It just low-key I think the vast majority of men masturbate for exactly that reason. Like I'm not going to go to work after 3 days of not getting something out of my body because then every interaction's just like I don't know. It's It's tough to convince people who are not male or extremely high sex drive female what it's like to live in a male mind. And like evolution's one hell of a force and it's always nudging you like, "Hey, hey, think about sex." And you're like, "I'm at work looking at code." It's like, "Okay, hey, think about some sex." You're like, "God damn it." And so for some people, I think the unccoring is actually super therapeutic. For some people, it's 50/50. And what you're saying is for others the uncquiring gets to be the focal point, but that's usually because they're coming from not so great alternative uses of their time basically. Yeah. In fact, they've looked so they've they've come up with this thing like um compulsive um is it compulsive sexual behavior? some terminology. Um, and basically when there was one study where they looked at the the characteristics of patients who had these these findings like these six characteristics or whatever and they overlied them with depression and they found that they were really like sort of in line with each other. So there may be that there's some conccomant like there's depression and they're actually treating their depression by doing these compulsive behaviors, right? Um, we don't know for sure. This is all really early thinking, but I think that there's something there, right? like we should be asking patients and checking for depression and you know vice versa. Yeah. When I have been seriously overworked in various phases of my life um you know like eventually at the other end of overwork is depression if you push far enough and then it's adaptive because your body's like we're going to turn off we're going to turn you off so you can recover. You're going to you're going to kill yourself if you go like this. And so what I found is that notions of eating tasty food, of getting lots of sleep, of I think uninterrupted relaxation time, and of nutting, for lack of a better term, are like start to look like these repositories of relaxation that you can go to. And the only reason they feel like that is because you're so fucking overwhelmed. And as soon as I became not overwhelmed, I'm like, "God, do I want to jerk off?" And the answer is like, "Nah, I'm good." And then you just go about your day. But if it's like, "Oh my god, this is guaranteed pleasure." and it just gets me away from everything. It starts to look good. So, I can totally see how folks in like not my junior league, not really depression, for real for real depression, that can be like your one of your only places of solace. Uh, and also I think describes a little bit of the vectors for obesity when people get really really really obese almost always. What I've noticed is food for them is their their hiding place from the world from their extreme stress they live in mostly in their own heads. But then again, stress only matters in your own head if you think about it. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and you know, orgasms are powerful, right? So, not mine. I mean other people. Mine are pathetic. Stop. Why are you laughing at that? No, but but really orgasms are powerful, right? They are they they can reduce your blood pressure. They can improve your heart rate. They can make you feel sleepy. They're super healthy, right? And and so they're so great for you. Like they're, you know, could we use them for pain control? Like, you know, could you use them for other reasons? Absolutely. And so I think people don't realize also that there's some people who all they can get an orgasm from is themselves. They don't have a partner or they can't get one, right? And so now you're taking them and saying, "Hey, don't do this. Don't do this wonderful like don't have this wonderful experience that makes you feel good because it's bad, right? In your head that it's bad and like, oh, it might turn into this terrible thing for you." But it's like, no, now you've literally taken someone who has nothing, like no person, no partner to actually have sex with, and you're saying, don't do this one thing that might actually make you feel good. Yeah. So I guess at the end of the day modulating your own testosterone levels, your own health and performance, your own vitality, your own psychological stable environment can be or rather ejaculation is uh even if it's uh um self-derived can range from anywhere between a real toxic thing you're doing too much of and it's not great for you all the way to like probably for most people like a normal thing that happens and it's just not a big deal all the way to a very important part of life that can be a hugely regulatory experience for you that makes you feel much better than if someone said just don't do this at all cuz it's bad. Absolutely. The whole spectrum. Absolutely. And I think that it's probably more good than bad for most people, right? Because I think it's easy for people to fearmonger and say like this is terrible, this is horrible. But I think most people would say like, yeah, I enjoy exploring myself. I enjoy having orgasms and it feels good and like it's great and I use it when I need to. Yeah. I think a lot of times we hear like comment sections and stuff get really negative about this and then you realize talking to those folks that these are precisely the folks who were triggered by an episode of unhealthy relationship to their own orgasms. Yeah. And not a judgment. It's just reality. We've all been in some weird places and they're coming from the perspective of I'm in this weird place or I have been. And they sort of just like all of us assume well everyone else is like this too. You know, it's like um folks that have had uh you know, currently sober folks that have been alcoholics before, they'll tell everyone alcohol is like the worst thing in the world. And for most people, it really is just like a few drinks and they're totally fine. And so it's just not true. But for folks like them, it really is the worst thing in the world. So there's a a validity of all perspectives, but not necessarily taking any one perspective and spreading it to all other people. Yeah. And then you know I think people also you know there is a lot of moral high ground when it comes to sex and self-pleasure and uh and people are raised in a certain way right there. Like think about it when you're a kid and like you are masturbating and your mom walks in or whatever. You're like stop that. I'm lucky to never have that memory. Well well that's good. I mean, they're they're like, "Stop that. Don't do that." You know, like whatever. And you feel embarrassed and you're like, "Oh," or like little kids will do it and they don't know realize what they're doing and then their parents like, "Don't do that here or don't do that in front of me." Or like, so you're immediately told, "Oh, this is something that I should be ashamed of like unintentionally." And you think that's not a good practice to I think that that there's a way to handle it where you're like, "Look, this is something that's fine to do. You just do it in the privacy of your own room. You know, we don't want we don't want other that's something you do with yourself and you enjoy with yourself and and it's fine for you to do. just, you know, you can't do it in the living room, right? Or whatever, right? But if mom walks into your own room, she probably is not on good ethical grounds lambasting you for it. You're like, actually, I was exactly in the right. Why are you in my room? She's just she's flustered probably, right? She doesn't want to see that. Oh my god. And then, you know, but it's like, okay, fine. Have that reaction in the moment, but then go back and say, I'm sorry. Like, I didn't mean to have that reaction. Like, I I think whatever you're doing was totally fine and normal and natural. I just was like nervous, right? You be a human. like it's okay to be human in front of your kids. I have two quick stories about that. One is three quick stories. One is I like to harass my dad every now and again cuz he gets very serious about things and he's super super smart but very serious. Very conservative Christian conservative. And um I asked him once I was like, "Hey, hey dad, what's what's okay to do in the bedroom and not okay to do in the bedroom?" He's like all serious. He's like, "Misha, Misha is my Russian name. Anything that you like and the woman likes to is okay." And I was like, "My dog." He's like, "Shut up. Shut up." That's as far as that convers that was the equivalent of my the talk. This I had to start my the talk. Good talk. It's a great talk. Super inclusive, but in a very like shut up about it. That's all we can talk about 100%. And then another story is I had a friend who I don't know how politically correct this is or not. I'm not naming names or anything, but some children start with autootic behavior very early. And then so um it's a soothing behavior. Soothing behavior. and and her parents literally were just like, "Hey, you know, this is something for you in your private time, so if you just don't do it around people, you're totally okay." That was the only conversation they ever had about it. She never had a hang up about it. I was like, I heard that story from her and I was like, "What an amazing way to deal with that as parents." They just totally cleaned up on that one. They could have done so much crazy shit. They could have been like, "Oh, you're too young. Therapy time." Something totally insane. So, I thought that was really wonderful. And then one last story. Um, one of my friends, um, his, uh, has an adopted son who at the time was, uh, 11 and his, sorry, he was with his biological, the adopted son's biological mother. And so, he he came into that relationship right? And the biological mother, it's just like, you know, like men and women, there's some differences there, and she's a little bit from another culture. And she's like, his kid's like 11, then 12, then 13. And she's like talks to my friend and she's like, "Why is you know the kid spending so much time in the shower and like she was knocking on the door and be like hurry up like wasting water." And my friend had to be like honey you got to let him be in there. And she's like why? He's like so he told her. She's like really? He's like yes do not bring it up to him. It's going to go really cuz you know the kid's in there trying to figure out his how his bits work. Mom's knocking on the show every five minutes. He's like traumatized. Yeah. So the the recommendation of just like let folks explore and treat it as a thing you do in private you think as a as a doctor is like a totally fine trajectory to go. I think it's a great trajectory. We we should know our bodies and so that we can actually eventually communicate those with a partner. What do I like? Sure. And I suppose insufficient shaming would be letting people do it in public in front of other people's view like you just weren't shamed enough. Shame is a nasty term. You weren't taught that that's inappropriate, right? It's just like as if you like chew with your mouth open, right? You weren't taught like to chew with your like same thing like you just weren't taught the the thing that this doesn't happen in public. But then at the same time, are you of the opinion that people on aggregate still sometimes maybe being shamed too much for their own sexual behaviors? And is that a problem? What do you think? Absolutely. No way. Absolutely. How is it a problem? I think that you know I think one it's like we like there's so much negativity around self-pleasure, right? It's fine to go have sex and like have sex with as many people as you want nowadays. That's okay. Great. Good job. You're empowered. But like when it comes to like exploring your own body and like trying to figure out what you like or being empowered or or whatever, it's like, oh, we don't talk about that and oh that's gross or like you know, whatever. There's a lot of like negativity around us still and no one talks about it, right? Like the conversation that we're having and the conversation that your friend had with their child like that doesn't happen. The parents don't know how to have the conversation. That's still true. So parents don't obviously back in the 70s it was just mostly shame and nothing else. Yeah. But now has that improved? I don't think they're I don't think they know I don't think they have the tools. Right. So a lot what happens a lot of parents don't know that they're not learning this stuff in school, right? They're just learning like here's a condom, here's consent. Like the banana and the condom banana, right? Like they're learning like I mean school has only so much time, right? They have to teach all these things. So I get it. Like they can't get into a deep dive. Uh but they are assuming that the kids learn everything they need to do in school. the parents maybe they're giving them some condoms or like here protect yourself don't don't have a you know don't don't get messy don't get pregnant don't get someone else pregnant whatever it is right um but that's pretty much where the conversation ends and so a lot of times they just don't know how to talk about it like they didn't get a conversation about it right when they were kids so they're like what do I say it's uncomfortable no one's really rushing into that conversation right but realizing like it's there's no comfortable conversations you just have to do it right like we are the parents like you have to just have the conversation whether you feel awkward or not, like you need you have to teach your kids like what's normal. Yeah. Doc, thank you so much. That was super super instructive. You're so welcome. [Music]
