You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. James Clear. We're going to come back to that in a second. Did you know that the average person loses over 30 days a year just scrollly on their phones? That's an entire month that you could have used to get in shape, start a business, or level up your life, and instead it disappears. And the scary part is that most guys don't even realize it until it's too late. And the only way to avoid that regret is to lock in starting today. Wasted time compounds into wasted potential. Let me explain. Every hour that you spend scrolling, watching random videos, or just chilling is an hour stolen from your future self. The two hours of scrolling aren't just two hours wasted. That's a gym session that you didn't take. Meaning no progress on your body. That's a business idea that you didn't brainstorm. Meaning someone else will launch it before you. It's like compound interest but in reverse. Right? Instead of building wealth, you're building regret. But the good news is that you don't need to overhaul your life in one night. You just need to lock in with systems in place. Going back to that quote by James Clear, you don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems. Achieving your goals will depend more on the systems of habits and processes that you have in place, then on the goals themselves. By building effective systems, you consistently perform the actions needed to move in the right direction, which ultimately leads to achieving your desired outcomes. And it starts with step one. Kill your biggest distraction. For 90% of guys, that's going to be their phones. Turn off the notifications because studies show that that will free up about 30 minutes a day. That's an extra 7 days a year that you just earned back just by turning off your notifications. Imagine what you could do in a week if you actually invested that time into yourself. Step two, replace. Don't just remove. So, if you delete Instagram, but you don't fill that time with something else, you're going to find another way to waste it. So, swap it out. Instead of scrolling for 30 minutes in the morning, read 10 pages of a book, lift weights, go on a walk, journal your goals. You know, the point is to use that time to level up instead of zoning out. Step three, track your progress like your life depends on it because it does. You know, write your goals every morning. Write down what you want to achieve that day and cross it off when you do it. The most successful people in the world, they're not just winging it. They're tracking. They're measuring. They're adjusting. And if you don't measure, you can't grow it. Step four, build a morning routine that doesn't suck. Now, you've probably heard morning routines so many times, right? Especially here on YouTube. It feels cliche, but here's the truth. Mornings can set the tone for your entire day. If the first thing you do is check your phone, your brain goes straight into reaction mode. You're already behind. Instead, your morning should be about offense, not defense. Keep it simple. Three steps. Move your body. Do some push-ups, a walk, go out, stretch, whatever gets the blood flowing. Feed your mind, read, write, review your goals. Should be quick. And then win something early. Make your bed, clear your desk, drink a full glass of water. These are tiny, tiny wins. What happens is they trigger momentum. And one of the easiest wins that you can have in your morning routine is simple. Start the day with a tall glass of water and your supplements. For me, that's stack. And these aren't your average horse-sized capsules. They're micro pills, tiny, easy to swallow. And because of their size, they actually absorb better. No more choking down giant tablets that your body barely processes. Here's how I look at it. If Apple designed multivitamins, they would look like this. Clean design, cutting edge tech, and premium from top to bottom. The packaging is sleek. The pills are microengineered and the nutrients inside are medical grade with 99% purity. Compare that to the typical multivitamin which is usually closer to 80%. That's the difference between driving a supercar and a beatup sedan. I'm also on the move constantly traveling, filming, working across time zones, so simplicity matters. And with Stack, there's no confusion. One stack in the morning, one at night. The day stack covers your key nutrients and has a delayed release code that gives you a natural energy boost in the afternoon, right when you need it. And then at night, the Evening Stack is designed to improve your sleep quality so you can actually wake up recharged instead of feeling groggy. If you want to check out Stack, use the link in my description for a special discount and see the difference yourself. It's that first link below. Look, systems are everything, right? Take Tom Brady as an example. When he was drafted into the NFL, he was the 199th pick. Six other quarterbacks were chosen before him. On paper, he wasn't supposed to be the greatest of all time. He was too slow, too skinny, too average. But Brady understood something that most people miss. Talent gets you noticed, but systems make you great. He built his entire career on locking in with systems. His diet was strict. His sleep schedule was consistent. His training routine was almost robotic. He didn't just rely on showing up to team practice. He created his own system of preparation. Every morning, he studied game tape before other players were even awake. He worked with throwing coaches in the offseason while others were on vacation. And most importantly, he stuck to those routines for over 20 years. Now, by the time other quarterbacks were declining, Brady was still dominating. Clearly, not because he had more talent, but because he had better systems. He didn't rise to the level of his goals of winning Super Bowls. He fell to the level of his systems. And his systems were built for greatness. That's why he's the goat. Now, think about that. In your life, you're not playing football, maybe, right? But you do need systems. Systems that guarantee results or personal growth. You can't rely on motivation. You need a framework that makes the right action automatic. That's what locking in really means. You know, you see this term being thrown around all the time, but the reality is locking in is all about these systems. An environment is stronger than willpower. So, most guys think that discipline is about raw willpower. It's not. It's your environment. It's always going to beat your willpower. If your fridge is full of junk food, you're going to eat junk food. If your desk is cluttered, you're going to procrastinate. If your phone is full of social apps and notifications, you're going to scroll. So, set up your environment to make good decisions automatic. Put your gym clothes out the night before. Keep your workspace clean. Use website blockers if you can't resist YouTube rabbit holes. James Clear calls this the environment design and it's one of the easiest hacks to locking in. And if you want proof, just look at Michael Phelps. You know, during training for the Olympics, his coach made him visualize his race every night, then practice it every morning. His environment was engineered for gold medals, not for distractions. When he swam, it was automatic. The reason why most guys fail is because they negotiate with themselves. You know, should I work out today? Maybe I'll start tomorrow. I'm not feeling good today. Every time you ask, you give yourself room to fail. High performers don't negotiate. They decide once and then let the systems handle the rest. Think of it like brushing your teeth. You don't wake up and wonder if you're going to do it or not. You just do it right. That's how your habits should feel. Build them until they're automatic. That is locking in. The next step is cut the wrong people out. Here's a harsh truth. Your environment isn't just your desk and your phone. It's also your friends, right? If you're surrounded by guys that waste their weekends, who clown you for trying to improve, who encourage bad habits, you're going to become one of them. That's that famous quote from Jim Ron, right? You're the average of the five people that you spend the most time with. Look at your five people. Are they building you or are they wasting your time? And if it's the latter, maybe you should distance yourself from them. It's about protecting your future. Think about shows like Entourage or Ballers. You know, the main characters, they rise because they're surrounded by people pushing them forward. But in real life, most guys stay stuck because their circle drags them down. Something else, too, is that not all habits are equal. Something you should do immediately is decide what your non-negotiable habits are. For me, that's going to be fitness. Once I started hitting the gym consistently, my confidence grew, my discipline grew because I knew I had to go every single day. And that confidence bled into my social life, my business, and discipline in every other area of my life. For you, it might be something else. Maybe it's waking up early, maybe it's journaling, maybe it's writing, maybe it's reading. But find the habit that upgrades everything. In the power of habit, they say that keystone habits reshape your identity. They're the backbone of your system. Something that I've noticed too is that motivation fades, right? You're going to wake up some mornings and feel nothing. No motivation. That's when most guys quit. But the people who win are the ones who can do the boring stuff over and over again. That's what locking in really means. Steph Curry didn't become the best shooter alive because he loved every single practice rep. He became great because he did thousands of reps whether he felt like it or not. You think he wanted to go to practice every single time? Obviously not, right? If you can show up when it's boring, you've already beaten 90% of people because they won't show up. But at the end of the day, systems will not work without this one thing, and that is purpose. Why are you locking in? Is it just to look cool, to keep up with others? Because if that's the case, you're going to quit. But if you tie it to a deeper why, maybe making your family proud, proving something to yourself, building freedom, you're going to stay locked in even when it's tough, and it will be tough. For me, my why was pretty simple. You know, I wanted to change my life. I moved to the US with nothing. I didn't want to waste this opportunity that my parents gave me. That fire is what made me keep going. Even when the results weren't immediate, and they they definitely weren't. So, what's your why? Think about it. Write it down. Put it somewhere where you see it every single day. Because here's the bottom line. you don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems. And if your systems are full of wasted hours, distractions, and excuses, that's exactly where you're going to land. But if your systems are built on habits, routines discipline purpose you're going to win. Time is going to pass no matter what. A year from now, you're going to be either the same guy, stuck, average, scrolling your life away, or you're going to be unrecognizable. You're going to be confident. You're going to be happy with yourself because you're locked in. So, the choice is yours. Lock in now or regret it
