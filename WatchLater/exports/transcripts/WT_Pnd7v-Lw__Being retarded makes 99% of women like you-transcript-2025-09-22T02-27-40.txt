In order to [ __ ] Max, you must never forget that inside of the short bus, it smells like piss and sweat. Okay. Tom Ford is a is a gay dude. He is gay. You need all this cologne to attract a girl. Oh, but this cologne smells like wood. This cologne smells like sand wood. This cologne smells like tobacco. You know who likes those scents? Dudes. Dudes like all those scents. You attract dudes. When you wear a bunch of cologne, you know who likes big jack muscle? Dudes. You think a girl gives a damn about all this? You think Oh my god. It just makes so much sense. Let me let me break this down, dude. Listen, because this is this is really where all the problems stem from is a lack. You know why India has the most kids? Because the pherommones are just freaking accumulating in the air. They're just falling down to the Ganes. People are bathing it. Just pherommones running loose. Pherommones running wild. It's just so many babies just the women are just breathing in. It does something to them. And so you think, "Oh man, I smell like my natural scent." Your girl should love how you smell. And if she doesn't love how you smell, then she is on probably an extreme dose of birth control, which is messing up her system, or you're not compatible. And and there you go. Maybe you're not supposed to be together, okay? Because your girl should love how you smell. Now, I'm not over here saying, "Dude, don't wear deodorant. Don't do don't don't bathe." Listen, I wear deodorant. I I brush my teeth. I scrub my body with soap. But I wear natural deodorant. I really think you got to wear some natural deodorant, dude. F all of this this this freaking um this Old Spice, dude. Old Spice I sold the other day for 12 bucks. It was more than that. I saw another deodorant for like 13. I'm like, who's doing this? Dude, you can make your own deodorant. I might actually start making my own deodorant. It's like coconut oil and some and some natural, you know, some baking soda or something. Get out of here. So, I'm just saying you don't need you don't like this is one thing that goes deep. They created a lack. They created a lack in your life that oh, I might need some cologne to attract. No, dude. You have the body that produces pherommones that literally exist in nature. And women, they smell this and they go like this. They get peaked. They get their interest is peaked. So, you're covering all this [ __ ] up with all these these different sense just spraying yourself. Dude, when I was a kid, I sprayed myself with baod. Okay, I got the three-piece bod from Walmart, and I left that [ __ ] thinking I'm going to be the hot thing in school. Little did I know, girls like when I smell like [ __ ] after gym class. You know, spraying axe all over yourself. Come on, man. Every problem stems from a feeling of lack. That's the world we lived in. the the system tries to break you down. It this is what this whole [ __ ] max thing comes down to is the system breaks you down. Dude, brother, the snake whispers in your ear somewhere along the line, you took the red pill. Okay, you willingly took the red pill. You ate the apple. Okay, you start to get stuck in here and believe that this was what's important. There was a disconnect between this and this, the gut the soul. You have to return to Eden. That's what we're doing. We're returning to Eden. Free powerful men. You know, another thing that is just, you know what I hate? those those podcasts where the guy is like talking to the only fans chicks. I that is super gay. I think like the only fans archetype the the woman would make the perfect freaking wife, dude. She would make the perfect wife. The only problem is that she sells is that you're not the dude. The only problem is is that the girl sells nudes to everyone, right? But that girl, that girl is the epitome of the female that you want in your life. That would just be the best, dude. A little dumb, a little bit like just being sexy, just shaking that thing, just getting freaky, you know? You want your girl to be a little bit of a freak, but your freak, you want her to be your slute. You want her to be and and here's the thing every woman has the propensity to be a salute to be an only fan slute you like they have that in them that is them that's them free just as the the the inside of man what is innate in man is that free unbburdened unchained unhinged a little bit of a frothing dog at the mouth you know just pure power, essence, un just unbburdened, uninhibited, a little bit gung-ho, a little bit of that Jenangis Khan. He thinks he could walk up into any room and make and burn it down. He thinks that he could freaking be the president of the United States. He thinks that he could go up into a room and every girl like he thinks he could be a professional athlete. He thinks he could be anything. It's that that uninhibited man, but something got in the way. Some block occurred. Same thing with the woman. So this guy sitting around question, dude, f all that. That's also a scab because you watch this, you start to develop a contempt, a disgust. You become a [ __ ] You start to see the you start to hate when really you're supposed to love. You're supposed to look at that like this. Oh, wow. This poor Oh, man. Such a beautiful woman. It's a shame that she didn't have that love in her life. That she didn't have a good man. Say, it's okay, baby. Daddy's here. I love you. I go, you know, twirl around for me. It's okay. You don't need anything. I'm going to be here. We're going to make it through, honey. We're going to get through this together. She never got that. So she listened to the whisper of the snake cuz she wasn't be able to connect to the source to God. So it's it created a lack in her life and many men have this lack in their life. So the lack runs very deep and I believe that if you let's go to we did the scent we did the simple buying of a scent to increase your smell to smell good. Same thing with prawn. If you struggle with prawn, I truly believe prawn and and also the big booties, the BBLs, Brazilian buttlfts, I think they're going out of style. They're going to be looked at as ratchet. They're going to be looked at as ghetto, as unnecessary. In Prawn, you see this as a young gentleman, as a young boy, and you discover these big booties, and you just think, what would it take? Subliminally, your subconscious thinks, "Do I have what it takes?" You know, do I have what it t? I mean, these are just massive. Just you got to just you got to freaking just freaking bench. I mean, it's a lot. It's a lot to handle. And so you go and you you stumble upon this prawn from a young age and you think to yourself, look at these monsters and and it starts to develop. I mean, you know, these endowed these well-endowed and you start thinking, is there a lack? Dude, this is 100% a scop. You can't I mean, it just connects like it makes you feel less do than the BBC. I mean, dude, it just freaking makes sense. It just makes sense. So, you develop this lack of spirit because sex is is the driving force of man. And so, you think, you know, you start to get almost this this, oh, someone else is handling that. How can I will I be it's a Here's the ultimate form of this and and as a man this is what I'm saying like you should not be be surprised by anything like if you're truly tapped in if you're truly tapped in to the power then you should not be surprised or even caught off guard by anything in life the whole girl that slept with a thousand dudes. Okay, this is the peak of the SCOP. This is like the next SCOP, the next wave that you have to deal with because subconsciously what it says is you weren't invited to the party. There's a thousand dudes that got to just bang out this one girl. You, my friend, were not invited to this party. And there's guys that have like willingly consumed to this. They've derived pleasure from watching this and it's it's a sort of shock you it's a shock shock and all just freaking cause a little bit of a young mind sees and this is why the young mind sees it and it's corrupted it it is it goes within the psych psychology goes within it goes more in here it's it starts to pull the soul from here the heart it goes in here it gets smaller it huddles over the man of power. Dude, if that was me, I'd be the first guy. I'd be I'd be the first one to the party, knock on the door, freaking flip over the bed, freaking put her head down. What are you doing? You don't need to do this. I'd freaking block off all the doors, put all the furniture by the doors, then I freaking take her like Princess Peach. Freaking That's why Mario, everyone likes Mario, you know, rescue the freaking take her ass out of there. Listen, stop this nonsense. Stop this nonsense. You have a line. There's 999 other guys in line just freaking waiting. You know, they're you know, they're just freaking waiting, taking their sealas and I'm I'm bursting open the door that I freaking barricaded and I'm setting the place on fire. That's how you got to that's literally how you have to become. You are that guy. These women, these these models, they're all humans. They're all humans. Nothing is above you. Nothing is above you, man. There is no lack. Not one lack in your life. Same thing. You know who else was a gay homosexual guy? The guy that created Victoria's Secret. I'm pretty sure he was at Diddy Parties. You do. You really like you. I'm talking to you as a friend. If you has your girl in front of you, do you need her to have on some skinny lingerie for you want to just just bam boom bada bing bada boom ha just freaking I'm ready to drop off a dime. I don't need no skinny lingerie. It's a freaking lack. They Oh, I got to buy some lingerie for I don't give a [ __ ] I don't care if she's wearing a a 3XL. Hopefully she doesn't need to wear a 3XL, but I don't care if she's wearing a 3. I'll rip that [ __ ] off of her and I'm ready to go. I don't need no lingerie. It's always to create a lack in someone's life. Think you need something, you need these gifts, you need and is dude, you got to call the shot. You got to play that play the game according to your rules. Be free, my friend. So, the system is meant to break you slowly but surely. That's what we're doing here. We're uncovering these types. We're returning to Eden, returning to a state of power and bliss because you are created in the image and the likeness of God. Seriously. Seriously, dude. If you don't if you don't truly believe that, how can you ever access your full power? Okay, so burn the suits. Burn the sense. Freaking breathe smoke, baby. Chew glass. two glass. You know, another thing I noticed that it creates a gigantic lack in a man's life is failure. And let me tell you, failure is a false god. And this god derives strength when it is worshiped and when it is looked upon like that golden calf. Failure is a false god. There is no failure. There is only life. There is only God. Life happens. When you go down, as Jung said, a a trees branches must reach down into hell in order to what? Go into heaven. The roots. Any failure in life, any any any downward trench or moment in your life, some some thing that happened to you is always a opportunity to ricochet to bounce towards heaven. You understand? That is such a big thing. When you look at life as a dance, as life happening, you dancing with life, you have the energy and the power to dance, dude. There is no failure. It's always it's always to benefit you. The people that are sort of hovering in limbo, those are the atheists. I I swear to God, the the middle holds the most atheists. The the people that are poor and weak, they need God. And the people that are strong are the only ones that can carry out God's mission. But the middle, the people that are stuck, that's where it holds the most atheism. So failure is a false god. You know, I think you need to bash your head a little bit. There's this story of the guy that had a labbotomy and he was this really cleancut polished individual and he had anxiety. He was afraid of the world. He got a labbotomy done. I think he had to get it. He had something wrong with him. Two weeks later, you see a picture of him. He's smoking a cigar. Anxiety obliterated. He's happy again. He even looks He's a little bit like this. He just He's free. Holy smokes, dude. He had to bash his He had to get freaking rattled. I really think you actually have to get a bit rattled. Now, I'm not saying bash your head cause brain damage. That's not what I'm saying, but I actually believe that you kind of got to be thrashed around a little bit. There was this thing uh in the looks maxing, right? If you have a thicker neck, it makes you look a little bit more attractive. Well, this is interesting. I thought about this. I When I'm super When I was super shredded before I did jiu-jitsu, my neck was just thin. Thin as a rail, chicken neck. When you see a bodybuilder with a thin neck, it looks like there's a sort of dissonance because there's a disconnect between this jacked body, but the neck which is functions like a bridge to the head. There's a disconnect. So it's like the mind is disconnected from the heart, from the soul. It's very interesting when you look at the anatomy of the nerd neck. You know, the nerd neck develops from a sitting posture hunched over just freaking bent over being smack by life over a computer over a desk sort of a slave sort of anatomy. So this it's very interesting to think that this bridge develops through play through play. And when we look at the people that we rever the most, we people worship athletes. Athletes are just what are they? They're just kids that kept playing. Wait, hold up. They're just athletes that kept playing the same game that they fell in love with since they were young and they got really good at it. They mastered it. So play is development. Play is improvement. Play is how we learn about ourselves. we disconnect ourselves from our body, which is our intuition, which is the gut. When we give up on play, when we stop getting bashed around, we stop roughousing, when we stop grappling, right? It's too heavy, dude. And this [ __ ] maxing is a return is a return to the bliss, is a return to the connection with God, return to the source. Okay? There's something deep here that has been lost in modernity because we're too much in here. We give too much praise to this. The system wants you more in here so that you're disconnected from here. It creates a lack with who the man is and it disconnects him. So the development of the neck is is a simp this uh this anomaly that occurs when the body is you know is sculpted in a gym stationary and again the the neck can be you know you clean a jerk you deadlift that'll get you a bigger neck the traps but also through sports through play through interaction with life and grappling with life cause you to actually get out of this right it's it's in the middle it's in the the depression state where you're consumed with this self-improvement. I really believe the true aim was to increase energy. That was the main aim. That was why you slept. Okay? Sleeping though became this science. You wear your little whoop. You wear your aura ring. You go to sleep. You track your sleep. You take supplements. Melatonin for sleep. Then you watch this guy on Joe Rogan about sleep. He's a sleep scientist. Kill me. You get good sleep. Okay. Then it became, oh, no fat. Oh, dude. My 90-day no fap streak. It was always the only goal was to have energy. You work out, you sleep, you eat good food. Okay. You You be social. That's a natural part of being a man. That is a natural part of being an athlete. That is a natural part of being someone who interacts with life. All those things come when you isolate those and you make those your main aim. It becomes here. It it becomes less about the body and living and more about tracking and science which is super gay. It was all about energy because energy connects you to the source. When you're connected to the source, you don't have to really think. Ideas magically pop into your head. Eureka moments. Boop boop boom boom boom boom. Just eureka. Eureka. You allow God to speak into your vessel. You understand? So that was perverted. That was deconstructed into a point of autism where, you know, guys forgot that as long as you have energy that is unobstructed from too much thinking, you will have intuition and spontaneity that arises. And that's what we're getting at here. And so when that antenna that's that's really it, dude. It there when that antenna is pure, when you have energy, when you have when you eat a little bit of sugar, eat the you know what I've been eating every morning? Dates and orange juice. Coffee and honey. Powering up the antenna. There's it's it's beautiful, you know. It's it's just pure energy. I mean, that is glycogen is energy and it's that's what the body uses. There is no there is no fear. There is no there's no failure. There is nothing that stands in your way. You are there is no impediment. God created you in the image and the likeness of him. There is no lack in your life at all. There is not anything in your life that that is does that not fill you with humos? Like at the core, is there not a a powerful hum at the core at the essence of being a man when you truly realize this? So I would say stop looking, stop searching, stop looking for outs. You have the permission. You got to stop looking for outs when when your intuition speaks to you. Stop looking for at the mishaps of other people. That's what so many people do. And it that is a huge block. They look at the missteps a at the uh the consequences of people that have tried. They look at how crazy the housing market is, how insane these women are. They're all [ __ ] They look at all the Donald Trump's our president. This is ah it's bad. They look at how expensive milk and eggs are and the price of gas. Everything is a confirmation to the spirit. Just like that girl that slept with a thousand dudes. Just like that you have a lack in your life. It's all a lack. It's a confirmation to you that you cannot make it. That you do not have the power to make it. That is why this anger and getting riled up is just a hindrance to reaching towards heaven. Heaven is here and now. You must become just like a child to enter the kingdom of heaven. It's a return to Eden, man. So you got to stop giving yourself out. Like you have to stop because life will advance life. Just as play advances play. You know, as kids, we we played. That's that's what we knew. We stopped doing it. But play furthered played. We got to meet our neighbors. We got to go to recess. We got to make friends. We got to further connections. We became adults. We started worrying about the future. You're not a fortune teller, dude. You're not a freaking fortune teller. So, there has to be a moment of complete surrender. There has to be a feeling of if I live, I live. And if I die, I have also lived. Death is just a portal. Death is just a portal to the next step. It's a door to more life. You're free. You got all the permission you need. Nothing's wrong with you. And for the guys that say that, you know, they look for more outs. Oh, it's about being handsome. Dude, you're Listen, God created you as a man. If you have two nuts between your legs, that's all you need. And even if you lost your nut, what is that called when they chop one of your nuts off? Maybe you lost a nut. big deal. You're still a man. You were born with two nuts. You're good. That's all you freaking need, right? You need to get around the people that build you up and they confirm. There's too many losers out there. There's too many people on YouTube trying to trying to make you feel lack in your life. You [ __ ] all that, dude. Let's smoke a cigar. Let's drink a little bit of Rome. Pirates life. I I captain, you know, like, dude, let's get it. God, it feels good to have some freaking testosterone. It feels good to be a man. That's all you need. I mean, it's really like you're worried about being so handsome. Like, what for, dude? What What for? Stop putting on [ __ ] cologne. Let the woman smell like [ __ ] for a little bit. Attract some women, you know? Like, oh, you're fat. Great. Interact with life more. Be an athlete. dance with life and you'll lose the weight. It's you're fat because you don't act with enough life. You're too in here. That's why the funniest [ __ ] are fat because you're too in here. It's funny to be in your head, right? You can think of a lot of funny [ __ ] but you also want to interact with life. There's a there's a there's a a dance that must occur, you know? It's like, oh, oh, another thing I know is, "Oh, you want to be handsome? Stop getting in here because often these perverted thoughts that go late into the night are accompanied by pale skin as Yukio Mishima said and fat flabby skin and these these decrepit men that don't dance with life what they do is they their thoughts become ugly and so on the outside the physomy also becomes ugly and the the ugliness appears with I've seen this I don't know what this is but like I'm about to shave. When my beard gets too [ __ ] unruly, I'm going to trim it up, right? Because But I see guys, they'll grow their beard out. They'll put beads in it. They'll [ __ ] spin it together like freaking Jafar and Aladdin twisted beard. They'll they'll make that [ __ ] just nasty. Okay. Little flexcks of doodoo in their beard. Listen, when you're on the open seas, freaking salt in your hair. Sure, let that [ __ ] run wild. But hey, man, you know, you got to look in the mirror. There's no see. There's no mirrors to see. So, you got to look in the mirror. Are you happy with what you see? And if not, stop hiding because I guarantee you that most of the guys that say they're ugly, they need to shave their [ __ ] head because that that hair is just a freaking curtain to the world. It's like putting like a blinder. Like you you got this long ass hair. It's so no one has to see your freaking face. You got this long ass beard so no one has to see your fat jaw. Shave the beard. See what's underneath. See who's hiding. Let your thumos come out. Or guess what? The belly of a whale awaits you. Too much running, too much hiding. Life is about being seen. It is. It's about being seen. Being free to be seen. You never see no You never see no Down syndrome guy with a big ass beard. They don't exist. And if they do, they're dwarfs in Lord of the Rings, which is fantasy. Sages have beards. You ain't a [ __ ] sage yet. All right, we got life to live. Let's get it, boys. Hi, Dumos. Anything else I want to say here? my antenna. Nothing. That's it, man. Come talk with us. Love to talk with you in the group. Keep it eyeumos. Peace.
