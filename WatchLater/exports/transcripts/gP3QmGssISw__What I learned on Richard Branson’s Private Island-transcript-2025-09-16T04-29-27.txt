I'm co-hosting a retreat with Sir Richard Branson at his private island. Come along with me for the experience and I'll share what I learned along the way. Let's go. Lesson number one, intuition is earned. One of the things that kept coming up over and over again was this idea of having good business intuition, having good gut instinct. It's something that you hear a lot of successful people talk about. But the important point to note is that that intuition is actually built up over time. It's not something that you're born with. And I find this to be such an empowering notion when you realize it because what it means is that you're not actually that different from these people. Like when I'm sitting in these rooms, my natural tendency is to say, "These people have accomplished so much more in business than me. They've made all this money. They've sold these companies. They've done all these things. They have such better instinct." The truth is that those instincts, that intuition that they've developed, it was developed over time. It was earned through actual reps. It's like a muscle that you can actually build over time. That is so important to realize because you may not be there yet, but you can keep getting those reps to earn that intuition. You can keep working at it to ultimately get to the point where you do have that intuition that allows you to scale and accelerate much more effectively. Number two, you are judged by your peaks, not your sums. One of the highlights of the entire weekend experience was getting to spend more time with one of my other co-hosts, an author named Adam Grant. Some of you are probably familiar with his work. He's written many successful books. Think again is probably his most famous and well-known book. What he was talking about was this idea that he has changed his mind on the role of hard work in achieving success. The reason that he's changed his mind is that he used to think that brute force hard work was how you achieved anything in life. So early in his career, he really focused on that just output sums if you will, the total amount of output that you can create. But now he's shifted to realize that really what it's about is peaks, the spike, the quality of one specific piece of work that actually gets you the notoriety or that actually leads to the success. I'm a little bit torn on this one to be honest because I really do think that sometimes the sums, the actual body, the quantity of work that you can create is what allows you to have more shots on goal to achieve the peaks. So, you can't achieve those extraordinary peaks if you have not had enough sums. I kind of come to something of a violent agreement with Adam on this, which is that early in your career in life, focusing on sums is effective because it gives you surface area. It expands your chances to actually go and achieve those peaks. Later in your career, as you continue to accelerate, focus more on the peaks. Narrow your energy and effort into the few opportunities that could really drive those peak spike outcomes. So think of it as sums first peaks later. Number three, we need to look back more often. This entire retreat was built around physical challenges. Every single morning, we would have some big ambitious, usually somewhat terrifying physical challenge. Then we would have more of the business and work and professional sessions later in the day. Well, the main physical challenge was a 2mile open water swim from Neker Island over to Mosquito Island. It's that island far off in the distance there. You get to wear like fins and uh you can wear a life vest if you want. Obviously, they don't want anyone getting hurt. Uh and there's safety vehicles and things, but it is still pretty scary for me. Now, to put this into context, I have never swam more than maybe a lap in a pool. I I don't think I'm a very good swimmer. I've certainly never swam in open water between two islands. We were swimming from Neker Island to this other island that was off in the distance and there were jellyfish all over the place and barracudas and you're swimming through this water. It's beautiful, don't get me wrong, but like if you've never swam a long distance in open water, that's really scary. So, we get into the water and I'm committed to trying to do this. There's all sorts of safety precautions. There's kayakers, there's boats, you're going to be fine. Uh, but it's pretty scary to just be out in the open water like that. So, I'm swimming for what feels like an eternity. and I popped my head up out of the water to look at where I'm headed and was immediately discouraged because it was so far away. It was like I hadn't made a single ounce of progress. It was still just as far as I remembered when I started off. But then I turned my head and I looked back to where I had come from. And I realized that that was actually pretty far away, too. I had come quite a long way. And I realized in that moment that I was making progress, that I was actually progressing towards my end. and it brought me a new energy. It actually gave me this thrust to push through and get to the other side. I did end up eventually making it. And when I got to the other side, I sort of reflected on that idea and just thought about the fact that this was really a metaphor for life. There's a lot of times when you are marching towards some big ambitious goal, the thing that you really want. And it feels so far off in the distance, you can't possibly see the progress that you've made. It's so intimidating. And there's a tendency in there to be stuck, to feel paralyzed, to feel discouraged. Sometimes in those moments, the best thing you can do is look back to where you came from. Because when you look back, you see that you've actually come much further than you think. And that provides you with the energy to keep pushing. So, if you're ever looking off in the distance at your goal, at that big dream that you have, and you're feeling discouraged by how far away it is, just remember to look back because you've come a lot further than you think. Number four, most people don't know what they want out of life. There's this really famous Naval tweet that went pretty viral that we can put up on the screen where he basically said that the only true test of intelligence is getting what you want out of life. I agree to some extent, but I actually think there's a layer deeper to that, which is the only true test of intelligence is knowing what you want out of life in the first place. I am blown away when you go and talk to all of these successful, incredible people. Very few of them actually can articulate what they want their life to look like. What is the life that you are actually trying to build? What is the money for? What are you going and chasing? What are you trying to create for yourself, for your family, for the people around you? Asking yourself why you want that thing? What is the real underlying motivation? what are you really driving towards is a pretty powerful exercise for understanding your true motivations. Understanding things that are really pushing you forward in life. And often times what you find is that things that you think you want in life are not much more than these surface level mimetic aspirations. Things that you think you want because other people have them or the people you're comparing yourself to have them. It's a healthy thing to do on a more regular basis to just audit those aspirations and ambitions you have and make sure that you're driving towards the right things. We all need to sit with that question a little bit more because once you have a clear vision of exactly what it is you are trying to create, what the life is that you actually want, then you can create a plan and you can take actions to go and build it. But if you never clearly articulate that, you may find that you march and march and march for years and end up somewhere where you never really wanted to be. Number five, stop doubling down on a losing hand. There's this idea in psychology of escalation of commitment. It is the human tendency to continue marching down a path rather than adjusting course even when the outcomes that are happening are negative. Humans have a tendency to double down on losing hands. Escalation of commitment to a losing course of action. We all need to avoid that trap. Avoiding that trap, being willing to step off the gas, pause, and adjust course is how we make sure we get to where we actually want to get to. In a way, this is all about a willingness to be wrong. So many people fear the idea of being wrong. You fear the embarrassment of admitting that you were on a losing path in the first place. You start some business, you're working on it, you want everyone to think you're impressive, so you're so afraid to pivot the business or to shut it down and walk away from it simply because you fear the embarrassment of publicly admitting that you were wrong. The truth is that no one is looking at you. Even if they notice that you went and did this, they're going to forget about it 2 minutes later when they're worried about themselves. So cast that aside, stop doubling down on losing hands, and you'll get to where you want to get to much faster. and with a whole lot more happiness along the way. Walking over to the talks for tonight. Last night there was a really interesting talk from a friend of mine named Blake Eastman who is arguably the world's leading expert on behavior and nonverbal communication. And one of the most interesting insights from that talk I thought was how he talked about the fact that we constantly apply context to the way people are communicating to us that actually isn't accurate and it changes how we communicate. It change how changes how we perceive other people and their intentions and situations. So, one of the things that he suggests we do is when someone communicates something to us and our initial reaction is very negative to ask what he says is five W's. Ask and create five versions of why the person actually might be communicating that way in that given moment. And when you do that, what you do is that you sometimes uncover the fact that your initial negative perception of the reason they were communicating the thing, sorry I'm winded going up a hill, is actually incorrect. There may be other reasons. It leads you to be more empathetic in social interactions and it leads you to sometimes uncover the fact that the person does not have the negative intentions that you previously thought. Number [Music] six, vulnerability is contagious and it breeds strength. You might assume that in a retreat where there were 30 plus ultra high performers across a range of fields that everyone is going to come in with some sort of bravado or braggadocio, everyone's going to be talking themselves up. But early in the retreat, a few people that I would consider some of the sort of higher status people among this group opened up about their own insecurities. They opened up in a vulnerable way and that sort of set the tone. And it created this ripple effect that truly showed that that vulnerability was contagious. All of a sudden, all of those veneers were pulled off and people were truly willing to open up. One of the things that I realize when people open up when they are vulnerable is that everyone around you feels comfortable to share their own vulnerabilities and you can wrap everyone else up to create a shared strength. Insecurity is a natural human condition. Imposttor syndrome is a natural human condition. All of these people that I was spending time with felt like an imposttor going there, just like I did going into this situation. It is a natural state that you're always going to have. But opening up, being vulnerable with others is what allows you to create strength over long periods of time. The natural push back that I always used to have to this one is that it's easy to be vulnerable once you've already made it. Like you you already won the game, you're already doing all the things. Sure, you can say all these vulnerable things. you've accumulated enough points to allow yourself to be vulnerable. What I would say to that now, what I would say to my younger self who would have that push back is that I agree that it is dangerous early in your career or life to be vulnerable to people that are significantly above you, the people that you are trying to create value for. But you should be vulnerable with the people that are in your peer group because those are the people that you are on the journey with. Those are the people that you're in the trenches with. So if you can find a small group of friends, people that you trust, people that are going to support one another and open up and be vulnerable with them, that will create a lot of the shared strength through that shared struggle along your journey. Number seven, maybe you can have it all. On the final morning of the retreat, Richard Branson approached me and told me that the talk that I had given about my book, The Five Types of Wealth, had kept him up all night. He was thinking about his own life and reflecting on what he needed to change, what he did and what he didn't do, what advice he might give to his younger self. My reaction back to him was, I really think you've been living by these principles, living by design across these five types of wealth throughout your whole life, whether or not you actually had a word for it. It feels like he's really cracked the code for a lot of the different types of wealth that I talk about. He's kind of designed his life obviously using money and all the business success that he's had to create this real like longevity beacon for himself here with the health and wellness, with eating well, with sleeping well, with the relationships, with activity, the sunlight, all these things. It's really incredible. Very, very inspiring. And he is so genuine and raw and real and authentic. But he's also been driven by purpose. He's surrounded by people he loves. His whole family was on the island during this event. They're all connected, great people. He's healthy, fit mentally and physically. He has this freedom to pursue things that matter to him around the world. He's really built his life around these principles. And I told him that that was something that was deeply empowering to me and I think to many other people that experienced it for one particular reason, which is that it indicates that maybe it is possible to have it all. to go and build a life where you build something large and ambitious and worldchanging but not sacrifice these other areas of your life that so typically get sacrificed along the journey. So I want to leave you all with that idea. Maybe we don't need to sacrifice one thing for the other along the journey. Maybe we can turn the dials, change them effectively over the course of our life so that when we get to our 70s, just like he is, we can have a life that is balanced and optimized across all of the five types of wealth. When I reflect on the experience that I just went through, I honestly just feel immense gratitude. My four or 5 year ago self would never believe the things that I get to now call work. It's truly remarkable to me and I feel a responsibility to share these ideas to bring all of you along for the journey to bring you into these rooms with me. I hope to do more of this in the months and years to come. I hope you enjoyed it. Click subscribe to follow along for more. Share this video with people who might find it valuable.
