Being productive is not about to-do lists and 
schedules. If you want to seriously improve   how much you can get done in a day without 
burning out, you need to master the ability   to do deep work. Deep work is when you are 
focused and locked in. It's when time flies   by and the work that you're producing is 
your best quality. If you're studying,   this is when things just click. You can cover 
a lot of content very deeply and very quickly.   Doing a deep work feels amazing and it makes 
being ultra productive much easier. But after   coaching tens of thousands of people to focus 
and learn more efficiently, what I've realized   is that most people don't know how to enter into 
this deep work state when they need to. Sometimes   they're focused, sometimes they're not. And 
overall, this means their productivity is   unpredictable. So in this video, I'm going to 
show you how you can activate deep work every   time you sit down on command. And there are two 
parts that I'm going to focus on. First of all,   I'm going to break down what deep work is at a 
cognitive level. Once you know this, you'll know   how to trigger it when you need to. After that, 
I'll give you a practical deepwork toolkit with   20 evidence-based tools and protocols that you can 
start using straight away. These are methods that   I use every day and I teach to my students and 
clients. So, let's start by understanding what   deep work is and why it happens to us. Deep 
work is basically when your brain is entering   into a state of high efficiency. So if this is a 
human brain, you just imagine this. And there are   different regions in the brain and they're all 
firing and communicating with each other. And   so all the signals and neurons firing in the brain 
are not always going to be uh all productive. Some   of these signals are just completely random. So 
for example, if you're sitting there daydreaming,   uh that's not necessarily productive or goal 
orientated, but your brain is still firing off all   these different signals. And so when you are just 
sitting there doing nothing at rest, your brain   is actually sending uh lots of signals constantly. 
And so your brain activity is very high. Okay? So   very high activity. And here's the interesting 
thing. What scientists noticed when they were   measuring the brain at rest is they realize that 
the human brain is actually more active in these   rest states than when we're focused on doing 
something and accomplishing a task. And so at   the time this state of high activity when we're 
not doing anything and just our mind is wandering   and we're daydreaming and we're having these 
random thoughts that was given the term default   mode network DMN and deep work is basically about 
suppressing the DMM. When your brain is in this   default mode network state, this is when it gets 
distracted. This is when you find it hard to enter   into flow. This is when you cannot focus. You 
can't concentrate. The quality of your work is   lower. To put it in a relatable sense, you might 
be sitting there trying to study for, you know,   one or two hours. But if your brain is spending 
most of that time in its default mode network,   you're going to finish that 2-hour session having 
accomplished basically nothing uh because you were   so distracted and your mind was wandering so much 
that you just wasted your time. And so the reason   this is really the crux of all productivity 
is that even if you prioritize the right task,   like okay, I know I have to study this thing or 
I have to complete this project. And then even if   your time management is great, so yep, at 12:00 
when you plan to start, you you always start and   you're very consistent. If the way you're using 
that time is not productive in the first place,   then it's kind of pointless. The output that 
someone can create in two hours of default mode   versus 2 hours of deep work is like night and 
day. And so since the goal of productivity is   not to just like randomly schedule things and 
you know go through the motions, usually the   goal of productivity is to get stuff done that is 
actually meaningful. That is mostly tied to your   ability to use your time in deep work. So trying 
to increase your productivity by focusing on time   management or even task prioritization when 
you can't enter into deep work is like trying   to read a book faster by flicking the pages more 
quickly but you don't know how to read. So the   question is how can we enter into this deep work 
state more consistently? How do we overcome and   suppress this default mode network? And there are 
two broad things that influence your ability to   enter deep work. The first thing are the tools 
that you use. There are methods and then there   are techniques that you can activate to enter into 
deep work states more effectively. And I'm going   to give you a whole bunch of some of my favorite 
most effective tools in a bit. But the other   part of this is your actual distractability and 
attention span. Your distractability or your sort   of natural attention span is how much your brain 
is trying to get back to the default mode network.   When you have a really really short attention span 
because you've like brain rot trained your brain   to just exist in like 30 second real spikes 
then your brain is constantly trying to get   back to being distracted and wandering. So if your 
distractability is really really high and so your   focus is really bad, then you need to use more and 
more and more of these tools to overcompensate. It   actually makes it harder for you to actually enter 
deep work more consistently because there are more   things that you have to do to be successful. It's 
an uphill battle and it's an uphill battle that   you're going to lose eventually because it is 
much more likely that one day you will become   too tired or you just can't be bothered using all 
of these tools to create deep work. If you need   to use 14 different strategies every single 
day to make the stars align and concentrate,   that is not sustainable. And so the main issue 
that I see in my coaching practice is that most   people who struggle with entering into deep work 
and and developing good focus have high levels   of distractability. And this is higher than 
ever because of social media. But instead of   working on improving the distractability, which 
is really what's going to make a difference,   they just overcompensate for their poor focus 
with more and more tool usage. And what this looks   like is like having multiple Pomodoro timers every 
single session, having these elaborate color-coded   uh systems of task and time management and you 
know elaborate notion or obsidian templates or   just like planning every single hour of every 
single day or having these really long deep work   rituals that last longer than the actual deep 
work itself. And so I'm going to share with you   both sides. I'm going to give you the tools that 
you should learn and use and experiment with and   figure out what works for you, but also teach 
you how to improve your distractability. And   the winning game is to be able to understand how 
distractable you are right now on any given day   and understand which tools you should use to 
activate that deep work. On some days you'll   need more. On some days you'll need less. But the 
result is that you can consistently control your   ability to enter into deep work anytime you need 
to. And the way I'm going to present this is on a   distractability spectrum. So this is your level 
of distractability down here. And we're going   to divide this into low level of distractability, 
medium, and high levels of distractability. So in   any given day you might be somewhere in here. So 
if you are in a high state of distractability on   a given day you should use more of these tools. 
If you're in a low state of distractability you   should use more of these tools. And it also means 
that if you find that most days you're constantly   hovering around here that is a red flag. That's a 
losing game and it's not sustainable. So it's an   indicator that you need to really work on training 
that distractability. Now, before I get into the   list, I will say that the tools and strategies 
I'm going to give you are comprehensive. They are   20 of what I think are the most effective uh ones 
that I would personally vouch for, but even then,   it's not everything. There are more strategies 
and more tools and different types of nuance and   context. And so, I'm not able to cover absolutely 
everything in this video. However, if you are   interested in staying up to date and getting a 
few more of these tools and these techniques,   learning some more strategies, not just about deep 
work, but also about learning and learning more   efficiently, then I would recommend that you check 
out my free newsletter. It's an email sent to your   inbox every single week, and I try to distill the 
insights and the strategies and takeaways that I   think are the most helpful for someone trying to 
learn and focus more efficiently. Each email takes   a few minutes to read uh and there's almost always 
a practical takeaway at the end of it. So it gives   you something to to work on during that week. So 
if you're interested in signing up to that, I'll   leave a link to that in the description below. 
Now getting back to the list. So let's start   with the first few. The first set of strategies 
is workspace optimization. Workspace optimization   is all about making your working environment less 
distractionheavy. Now again, it's sitting here in   this low distractability section, which means 
that on most days, whether you're feeling very   distracted or not very distracted, this kind 
of sits as a foundation. So, if possible, you   want to be optimizing your workspace every single 
session. And there are four very simple strategies   as part of workspace optimization that I've used 
extensively. The first one is setup. This is just   about creating a dedicated physical space for you 
to work in. Now, here's a few tips to do this,   right? First of all, you don't need to create some 
kind of workplace masterpiece. You know, I've got   a a desk. You know, it moves up and down, which is 
nice. I've got some monitors. It's clean. I can do   my work on here. It's enough as long as you just 
have a space and this is a dedicated space for you   that you can associate with working. Which brings 
me to tip number two. Try not to do anything else   on that same space. I used to be uh a bit of a 
gamer. Uh and so I used to work and game on the   same desk. And so that meant that there was this 
crossing over between a space for me to relax and   enjoy myself versus a space for me to be focused 
and concentrating. And that's not very good. It's   going to make it harder for you to enter into 
deep work. And so what you can actually do is   even if you are in the same space, let's say it's 
not possible for you to move to another room or to   use a different computer or have a different desk 
somewhere else, you can at the very very least,   by the way, if you can do that, you should. But 
if you can't, you can uh use little visual changes   to your workspace that indicate to you mentally 
that this is relaxation mode versus work mode. So,   it might look like, you know, using a different 
kind of desk mat and then rearranging where your   computer or your monitor's face or where your 
keyboard sits. And then because you've changed   how it looks like, you've made that clear break 
between focus versus play. You can also apply the   same principle to uh the area of your room itself. 
So, ideally, you don't want your workspace to be   in your bedroom or in a leisurely room. So, I've, 
you know, lucky enough to have an office. Like,   I don't enter into this room for anything other 
than work. But if that's not possible for you,   then, uh, a tip that I'd recommend, which I used 
for years, and I recommend it to all my students,   is to get a cheap screen divider, like a dressing 
room divider. You know, it's like those kind of   folding panels, and you can just pop those up 
behind your desk to create a partition in your   room and almost create like a mini cubicle for 
yourself. I've also got this portable lap desk   thing. basically this plank of wood with a cushion 
underneath it. And I leave that in the car because   I'm often working while I'm on the road. So it 
means whenever I need to, I can just pull over,   jump into the passenger seat, get my little 
portable desk out, and I've created this mini   workspace for myself. And I'm able to actually 
get some really good effective deep work done.   So that's the first uh strategy in workspace 
optimization. The second strategy is very simple,   ergonomic positioning. Once you enter into deep 
work, which by the way usually takes about 5 to   20 minutes for a healthy brain to exit out of that 
default mode network. If you have a really high   distractability or your attention span is just 
fried or you're just feeling tired or fatigued,   you didn't get enough sleep that day, then this 
amount of time can be longer. But once you enter   into deep work and then you exit out of it, to 
enter back into deep work takes just as long.   So if it took you let's say 10 minutes 
then coming out of deep work might only   be 1 second. That brief interruption could 
just whip you out of deep work. And now you   need to spend another 10 minutes to enter into 
deep work all over again. So once you're there,   you want to stay there for as long as possible. 
And ergonomic positioning is just a very very   simple change to reduce the chances of you being 
pulled out of deep work. This basically means sit   in a way that's going to be comfortable for you 
long term. Try to have relatively healthy posture,   sitting upright, not like hunched over like in a 
corner, you know, your neck jammed up against the   wall. One really quick tip, and this is getting a 
little bit detailed, but I believe in this a lot,   is actually monitor height. So, for me, I actually 
found that after doing long periods of deep work,   my neck gets really uncomfortable. And this was 
actually because I used to have my laptop just on   the the desk. And so, I'm actually straining 
down the entire time when I'm working. So,   not only does this cause discomfort and strain, 
which pulls you out of deep work, but it's also   just bad for your posture. And so, the ergonomic 
way of doing this is to have the top of your   monitor at eye level. And that just helps to keep 
your spine in a more neutral position. So, that   was the second part of workspace optimization. The 
third one is visual decluttering. If you're really   easily distracted by stuff on your desk, just 
clear, obviously, visually distracting elements.   But here's the part that most people don't think 
about. Visual decluttering is also about what you   can see when you are at your workspace. One of my 
students uh would always get distracted by their   cat because their desk faces out into the living 
room and the cat is like roaming around inside the   house. And so one change they made was to just 
flip the desk to face the wall. So next time   you're at your workspace, pay attention to the 
things that you get distracted by and see if you   can remove those. Now, as for the cat, cats being 
cats, it probably just ended up sitting on his   keyboard or something, so I don't know if it made 
a difference, but anyway, the fourth strategy for   workspace optimization is notification management. 
Your phone has a do not disturb mode. Please use   it. Turn off all your non-emergency alerts. A 
phone notification is probably the most common   reason people break out of deep work. You're 
doing some great work and then you check your   phone after 5 minutes, okay? And then you get back 
to work and then you check your phone again after   5 or 10 minutes. Well, you're never entering into 
deep work because you're never letting yourself   go uninterrupted for more than 5 or 10 minutes. 
Remember, it takes 5 to 10 minutes to enter into   deep work in the first place. And that's if you 
have low levels of distractability. Chances are,   if you're used to checking your phone every few 
minutes, you need up to 20 or even 30 minutes to   enter into deep work states. So, that's workspace 
optimization. And again, these are strategies   that you can use every single day. They're very 
sustainable. The second one which is also in this   low category that you can also use every single 
day is body optimization not body odor BO body   optimization. In essence healthy body healthy mind 
when your body is in a good condition your mind   finds it easier to focus. In fact fatigue or sleep 
deprivation is one of the most common reasons that   you're going to find it hard to enter deep work 
even if you are typically someone that doesn't get   distracted very often. And so the first strategy 
within body optimization is just sleep hygiene.   Have a regular sleep schedule. Have a windown 
routine. Avoid your screen time. Don't have coffee   between the 5 to 6 hours before you go to sleep. 
Get enough sleep in an environment that is dark   enough and quiet enough. If it's not dark enough, 
put some blinds up. Get an eye mask. If it's not   quiet enough, get some earplugs. Play some white 
noise. Turn on your brain FM sleep sounds. I   feel like I say this every video, but sleep is so 
important. And I am sick of hearing all of these   toxic productivity gurus talking about how, you 
know, you don't need sleep or minimize your sleep   or whatever it is like hustle till you die. Just 
sleep. A life in sleep deprivation is not a good   time and it's really counterproductive. And also, 
if you didn't know, sleep deprivation increases   your risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's. 
So, I guess in a way, sleep is really productive   for getting Alzheimer's. Now, the second strategy 
in body optimization is just exercise. So,   there's actually a few interesting parts of this. 
First of all, uh regular aerobic exercise not   only increases your health and improves your 
sleep quality, uh but it also increases your   cognitive function. So there is a direct link 
to exercise and your ability to concentrate,   focus, and perform. Exercise also seems to have 
a direct positive influence on the suppression   of that default mode network, which means that 
sometimes you can go from high distractability   to lower distractability by doing nothing else 
other than just adding exercise into your routine.   And this also seems to work on a smaller scale. 
So in a single session, let's say that you're   losing focus, it's been one or two hours, you've 
done some great work, and your deep work is sort   of naturally fading away. You can actually use 
a movement break to get back into focus more   quickly. So instead of just you know scrolling on 
your phone for like one or two hours which doesn't   improve your ability to enter into deep work later 
you can actually go for like a 15minute walk and   then when you come back you'll feel that you're 
able to enter into that deep work state much more   effectively than if you were just sort of sitting 
there doing nothing. So that was exercise and the   third and final part about body optimization 
is hydration protocols. So here's something   interesting. You're probably dehydrated right 
now. I am almost certainly dehydrated right now.   Here's some crazy information for you as a former 
medical doctor. Dehydration impairs your entire   body and your brain. It affects how nutrients 
are delivered and how waste is cleared from your   cells. And your brain tissue actually shrinks 
physically in dehydration. And so this causes   brain fog. It causes fatigue. It causes headaches. 
It makes it harder to concentrate and focus. And   all of this can happen with just a 1% loss of body 
water. And you know what the symptom of a 1% drop   in body water is? It's literally just feeling 
thirsty. Just the feeling of thirst is already   an indication that you're entering into the early 
stages of dehydration. And by the time you have a   dry mouth and your lips are dry, you're already 
into moderate dehydration. So here's a hydration   protocol I recommend. Have a big drink bottle next 
to you and aim to have a big mouthful of water   every 10 to 15 minutes. Try to get through about a 
cup of water every hour. Obviously, if you're like   really hot and sweating or you're exercising, 
you're going to need more than this. You can't   uh batch this. You can't have just like one liter 
chugging it down, you know, once every few hours.   Your body can actually only absorb so much water 
in one go. So, if you just have a huge amount of   water, you're going to pee most of that out and 
your body's not really absorbing most of it. So,   big gulp every 10 15 minutes is best. Now, if 
you're properly hydrated, uh you're actually going   to end up going to the toilet much more often than 
you normally would. But that's very normal and   that's actually a sign of hydration. That means 
your kidneys are nice and healthy. Okay. So now   we're in the medium distractability column. And 
there are two categories of optimizations in here.   These are focus protection and focus restoration. 
For most people who say they struggle with   entering into deep work consistently, in these 
categories of strategies, you're going to see that   it starts becoming much easier. So starting with 
this first one which is focus protection. There   are five strategies that you can use within this. 
The first one is noise control. It is really hard   to focus if someone is having a heated argument 
next to you. And so especially if you are needing   to focus in situations where you can't control 
the noise in your environment, you should use   some kind of noise control system. So obviously 
there are things like earplugs or ear muffs,   uh noise cancelling headphones. What I'd recommend 
that you do is you add on a layer on top of that   which is using white noise. White noise generally 
means a constant steady repetitive sound usually   uh with a sort of hissing kind of characteristic. 
So if you imagine the sound of rain or a river   flowing by. These are sounds that can drown out 
the noise around you without being distracting.   Now, if you want to take this a step further 
so that the sound actually forces you into a   state of deep work, there are actually certain 
sounds that can stabilize your brain's electrical   activity. This is a phenomenon called neural phase 
locking. And for those that struggle with focus,   uh, entering into deep work, especially if you 
have ADHD, this can be incredibly effective.   And the easiest way to get these sounds, and this 
is what I use, is to use Brain FM. And they're   actually the sponsor of this video as well. Brain 
FM specializes in this scientifically backed focus   music. And the cool thing is that when you sign 
up, it actually personalizes the sounds you hear   depending on your own preferences and the type of 
work that you need to do. And so if you want to   do some deep work or if you want to go to sleep 
or if you want to do something creative, it will   give you different types of sounds. I definitely 
recommend checking them out. Uh, you can use my   code brain.fm/justinssung and you'll be able to 
get unlimited access with a 30-day free trial.   Just give it a go, see if it works for you. If 
you don't like it, you can always cancel, but it   is actually surprisingly just very effective for 
most people. So, that was the first part of focus   prediction, noise control. The second part of 
focus prediction is time blocking. Time blocking   is when you just have a block of time in your 
schedule where you have dedicated that to doing   something. In this case, you want to schedule 
in deep work as a time block. So, between 2 to   4 p.m., you're going to have a deep work study 
session. But here's the key about time blocking.   Just because you put it into your calendar doesn't 
mean it's going to happen. If you create a time   block, you need to protect that time. So, once 
you've added it into your schedule, ask yourself,   what might stop me from being successful with 
executing on my plan? A great example is I used   to schedule things at like 5:30 a.m. So it's 
like I'm going to wake up early in the morning   and then I'm going to do this really focused, you 
know, period of work and then I'm going to go,   you know, go to work or go to uni. And that was a 
terrible idea. I had a very very low success rate   because I hate waking up early. I also had to work 
late into the night a lot of the time. So I wasn't   getting enough sleep. So as a schedule, that is 
a terrible idea to put it in somewhere that is   so high risk. If I was committed to making that 
time work, I need to take steps to protect that   block. So that would mean going to sleep earlier, 
which means rearranging my work, changing my work   meetings and my work schedule. And if that is too 
difficult to do, do not schedule it here because   you cannot protect that time. The analogy I give 
is like a baby. A baby is an incredibly precious   thing. Just like your time is incredibly precious. 
You wouldn't just, you know, put your baby on the   floor and then just go for like a 3-day holiday. 
you would think about, okay, how can I protect and   take care of my baby? Hire a babysitter. Make sure 
the knives aren't just like all over the floor.   Have a little gate in front of the stairs so your 
baby doesn't fall down. And if you can't protect   your baby sufficiently, you're not just going to 
be like, "Oh, well, I'm sure it'll be fine." And   just go on your holiday anyway. So, think about 
your time like that. If you've blocked something   out, it's precious for you. It was important for 
you. That deep work means something for you in   your life. So, protect it. And if you can't 
protect it, move it to somewhere else where   you can protect it. So that's time blocking. The 
third strategy is using app blockers. This one   is very simple. There are lots of different app 
blockers. Figure out which apps are distracting   you. Block them. If one app blocker isn't working 
enough for you, use a different one. Also,   most likely those same apps are probably 
training your distractability to become   worse over time. So blocking them might actually 
help you to reduce your innate distractability.   Strategy number four of focus protection is single 
tab working. Now based on the screen share of some   of my colleagues, I know that this is going to be 
really hard for some people, but try not to have   so many tabs open at once. Only have essential 
apps and tabs open when you're working. The reason   this is important is that deep work is actually 
quite a fragile state and there are lots of things   that can break you out of it. And one thing that 
is very strong at breaking you out of deep work is   context switching. That's basically when you're 
working on something and then you have to work   on something that's very different. Like you're 
writing an essay and then now you have to check   an email. Well, when you have lots of different 
tabs open, you now need to make the decision   about which tab you need to get to and navigate 
between. And that is actually a context switch.   you're going from being in this great deep work 
flow state to now changing to navigating state.   And so that can actually be enough to pull you 
out of deep work. Another thing that happens   is that each open tab, especially if you've 
opened a bunch of them recently, creates this   open loop within your brain and it unintentionally 
activates something called the zygenic effect. The   zygenic effect basically says that when you start 
something, it's easier to come back to finish it.   Now, this can be very positive for developing 
new habits. You can start a project, you know,   last thing before you go to sleep, just a few 
lines, but it means that tomorrow morning, it's   easier for you to just roll back into the task and 
keep going. But there's a negative aspect to it,   too, because your brain is holding on to cognitive 
resources, ready to jump back into this task. It   means that that open tab is using up unnecessary 
cognitive resources that aren't productive for   what you're trying to do right now. This creates a 
sort of cognitive tension within your brain which   makes it easier for your mind to start wandering 
thinking about other tasks and then boom now   you're back into that default mode network. So 
that's the fourth one single tab working. The   fifth one within focus protection is cognitive 
offloading. To enter into deep work you want   to have as much of a singular focus as possible. 
Everything your brain is doing is for a specific   task or a specific goal. And ironically, one 
thing that makes it really hard for your brain to   maintain that singular focus is actually trying to 
remember what your goal is in the first place. If   your brain is working really hard to try to solve 
a problem, you don't want your brain to stop doing   that to then say, "Wait, what was the problem 
again?" That very act of trying to remember the   point of what it's doing can actually break you 
out of that deep work state. And so cognitive   offloading is actually about writing down what 
your goal and objective is for that session or the   or the mini session. You can have multiple goals 
in a single session and actually writing it down   and then putting it next to you. So every time 
you're wondering what was the goal, what do I need   to be focusing on, you don't have to break out 
of your thought pattern to remember what it was,   you can just look at your note to remind yourself. 
This is a really simple strategy that I especially   recommend if you have ADHD. So that is focus 
protection if you use those strategies. And again,   you shouldn't need to use all of them, but these 
are the ones that allow you to enter into that   deep work state and then stay in that deep work 
state. The next category is focus restoration.   Focus restoration is about if you've come out 
of a deep work state, how do you enter back into   another deep work session more easily? And there 
are three strategies we can use here. The first   strategy within focus restoration is one that 
I've already touched on before, which is attention   restoring activities. Exercise was the one that 
I gave you before. You can use a movement break.   If you're feeling a little bit distracted, go for 
a walk. This helps to regenerate that focus. But   there are other things outside of exercise that 
can also help to regenerate that focus. There's   a concept of a productive break, which is when 
you do something that is somewhat productive,   but not mentally stimulating. You're letting your 
brain rest while keeping it in this flow state   of concentration. Great example of this is like 
housework. cleaning the house, doing the dishes,   organizing your room, maybe even just preparing 
for your next session, cleaning a few things   up. The main thing about this is that you want 
to disengage from anything that will draw you   back into that mind wandering default mode network 
state. You want to give your brain a break without   giving your brain a distraction. So, it means 
no scrolling on your phone or playing games. So,   how long should these breaks be? I normally 
recommend a 3:1 or a 4:1 ratio. So if you've   been focusing and doing some deep work for 45 
minutes, you might take a 15minute rest. That   would be a 3:1 ratio. If you've been doing 
3 to 4 hours of focused concentrated work,   you might take 1 hour break. That's a 3 or 4:1 
ratio. Another thing that you can do during   this break is the second strategy within focus 
restoration, which are breathing techniques.   Breathing techniques are an incredibly effective 
strategy that I actually think every functioning   adult should learn how to use. Some people teach 
this in a way that gives very hippie vibes. Uh but   it's an incredibly scientific evidence-backed way 
of improving your focus, restoring your energy,   and regaining concentration. The reason breathing 
techniques work is that there is a direct neural   connection between your breathing and your brain. 
Your vagus nerve which directly connects to your   diaphragm and controls diaphragmatic breathing 
is also a major nerve involved in relaxation. So   the act of deep diaphragmatic breathing forcibly 
activates a relaxation response in your brain. In   addition, deliberately trying to create rhythmic 
controlled breathing patterns forces you to have   a clear goal and focus in mind that your brain 
can anchor onto. This in itself creates a mini   deep work state that takes it out of that default 
mode network. Instead of wandering, it is focused   on slow controlled breathing. In fact, that uh 
neural phase locking I talked about before where   certain sounds can actually stabilize your brain 
activity. Well, this type of neural entrainment   can actually happen with your own breathing. Your 
own rhythmic breathing can actually synchronize   your brain waves into a calmer, more stable state. 
And this is the reason why breathing techniques   are used not only as a treatment for conditions 
like anxiety, but also trained in almost every   high stress, high pressure industry in the 
world. And there are two very easy uh breathing   techniques that you can use. The first one is 
called box breathing. It means you breathe in   for four seconds, you hold it for 4 seconds, you 
breathe out for 4 seconds, and then you hold that   for 4 seconds. Another one is called 478. This one 
is personally my favorite. It means you breathe   in for 4 seconds. Deep big breath, 4 seconds in, 
and then you hold it for 7 seconds and then you   breathe out very slow and controlled, relaxing 
out for 8 seconds. So give those breathing   techniques a go. Learn to use them, master that 
as a technique. And I'd recommend using them   immediately before and after deep work states. So 
before you enter into a session, do a few rounds   of that breathing and then as you enter out of it, 
do a few rounds to bring your mind back to stable.   Now the third focus restoration strategy is 
meditation or mindfulness meditation. And again,   this is one of those things that has I think 
a lot of misconception around it. People think   about meditation and they think about head shaven 
sitting in a temple in the middle of the mountain   somewhere you know levitating off the ground where 
they think it's something that you should do only   after your Sunday morning hot yoga class but 
mindfulness meditation is actually again one of   the most scientifically evidence-based methods 
for not only restoring your focus but actually   training and reducing your distractability 
and actually it is one of the most effective   strategies for someone who has a high level of 
distractability to eventually get lower and lower   over time. So, you can find some YouTube videos 
about how to do mindfulness meditation. You can   use apps like Headspace or Calm or Insight Timer 
to teach you. But if you're going to give this a   go, I'm going to tell you three things about this. 
The first thing is that it takes time. If you keep   doing mindfulness meditation, your distractability 
will improve. Your attention span will improve.   Your concentration will get better. These things 
will happen, but it takes time. Often, if you are   really highly distracted, it can actually take 
months. And so it's one of those things that you   have to believe in and continue doing consistently 
for a long time to really stack up that benefit.   Most people will not see it through for that 
long. And I just highly recommend that you give   it a go. The second thing is that the point of 
meditating is not to be in a state of peace, calm,   and tranquility. The point is to get distracted. 
The point is for your mind to wander. The point   is for your brain to enter into that default mode 
network and start daydreaming and having all these   random thoughts. And when it happens, you bring 
your attention back to whatever you're doing,   whether it's your breathing or your walking or 
whatever uh mindfulness kind of attention anchor   that you're using. And it is that act of actually 
being distracted and then coming back that trains   your brain. So don't be put off because your 
mind is wandering every 1 to two seconds.   It just means that you're getting one opportunity 
to bring your focus back every second. And the   more reps of that that you can get in, the 
faster your brain will retrain itself. In fact,   the evidence for this is so clear and I'm such 
a believer in this that if I had to recommend   only three things within the entire middle list 
of middle distractability techniques that you   should use, it would be mindfulness because it 
trains your distractability to become better. the   noise control because sometimes too much noise is 
just impossible to focus through and app blocking   because social media apps are so engineered to 
hack our brain and our distractability that it's   going to undo all the good that our mindfulness 
meditation is doing. So those are the two   uh focus protection and focus restoration groups 
of strategies for if you have a middle level of   distractability. So most of the time on most days 
you should be hovering within this kind of band.   On some days you may need to use the strategies 
in this high level of distractability band. Some   of you may be operating within this level most of 
the time in most days and if that is the case you   need to do some more mindfulness meditation and 
bring yourself back to the lower end. So let's   look at what the high distractability strategies 
are. Again there are two different categories of   uh high distractability strategies and the first 
one here is urgency strategies. Urgency strategies   are about creating a sense of urgency that forces 
your brain to try to focus in. And the reason this   works is that urgency creates a mild stress 
reaction. And that stress reaction actually   helps to shut down some of the unnecessary mind 
wandering which makes it easier to shift away and   suppress the default mode network. And so there 
are three different types of commonly used urgency   strategies. The first one are pomodoro variations. 
So this is just any time where you have a timer   and that timer counts down how long you have to 
work for and then usually it's followed by a rest   time. So the classic one is 25 minutes of work and 
then 5 minutes of rest. But there are all sorts of   different variations of timing. So using something 
like a pomodoro timer and setting a time that is   actually literally counting down as you work 
can be great for creating that sense of urgency   and entering into that deep work. However, if you 
look at how top performers usually enter into deep   work on most days, you'll find that a very small 
percentage of those people are regularly using   things like Pomodoro or variations. And the reason 
for this is that it's not very sustainable and it   also shouldn't be necessary. Like I mentioned 
before, the reason urgency creates focus is   because it creates a mild stress reaction. And 
so, if we're relying on this to create focus every   single time, it creates a prolonged chronic stress 
state. Not only does this eventually increase your   risk of burnout and attention fatigue, but 
it actually becomes counterproductive when   you maintain prolonged states of frequent 
constant urgency. It actually reduces your   critical thinking and your creativity. It reduces 
the flexibility in your thinking. It increases   the accumulation of fatigue. It can damage the the 
quality of your sleep as well, which creates this,   you know, negative spiral. And it can actually 
just make it harder to concentrate in the first   place. So now you're dependent on urgency to 
concentrate, which remember it's getting harder   and harder to do. As a bonus, uh it can also 
reduce your immune system, which means you're more   likely to get sick. And you know, getting sick is 
not particularly productive. And so if you find   yourself constantly needing pomodoro timers to get 
any work done, uh for me, I would view that as a   clear red flag. Yes, you can use these strategies, 
and I will use these strategies on a bad day,   but it should be reserved for a bad day. And this 
is kind of the trend for everything in this red   column, which is that they're all things that you 
should reserve for when you really need them. The   second strategy with an urgency is accountability 
or focus buddies. What I'm referring to here is   having someone next to you, either physically 
or digitally, to sort of keep you on track. And   you're replacing the urgency that you feel from 
a clock ticking down like with Pomodoro with the   social pressure that someone is watching you 
with certain expectations of you and basically   it creates a very similar kind of stress response. 
Now the caveat here is that you can certainly have   accountability and focus buddies and it can be 
very healthy. It can offer a lot of social and   psychological support. It can actually just make 
what you're doing more enjoyable in the first   place. Where this becomes unhealthy is when you 
feel like you need this person in order for you   to do deep work and focus. And without this 
person, you don't feel motivated or you feel   incapable of concentrating. If that's the case, 
then again, that's a red flag and you need to work   on training your baseline distractability. And 
the third urgency strategy is energy budgeting.   Energy budgeting is like treating your own mental 
energy and your focus and your concentration like   you would treat money and you're distributing it 
strategically throughout the day. So you might   have some deep work you want to get done early 
in the day and you frontload that. So you spend a   lot of that mental energy there which means that 
afterwards you spend a little bit less. So you   might have a period of rest and then you might 
have uh some shallow work that doesn't require   so much mental energy and you're basically trying 
to schedule in your deep work blocks in the times   where you know you are likely to have that 
peak window of energy and concentration. Now   so far that overall is not a bad practice and 
there's actually nothing you know unhealthy or   unsustainable about doing that. But what I found 
in reality from coaching people that use this sort   of energy budgeting strategy is that there are 
some red flags and it can seriously backfire. And   so if you're using energy budgeting, then this is 
what you should try to avoid doing. First of all,   don't tie your deep work exclusively to these 
peak windows. I find that people that do a lot of   this energy budgeting uh can become quite rigid or 
fixed in understanding when they can do deep work.   And sometimes it's actually more important to be 
able to trigger and enter deep work whenever you   can rather than strictly budgeting it up front. 
It can also lead to overguarding of that mental   energy. You basically hoard this energy for when 
it really matters for that really great deep work   block. But then sometimes that deep work block 
never comes or something unexpected pops up.   And so actually your overall productivity tanks 
because you're just trying to wait for the perfect   moment rather than just making use of the moments 
you have available. So while it's great to try to   do meaningful deep work earlier in the day when 
you might have more energy and less distractions,   sometimes you might need to do an hour 
of deep work at 5:00 p.m. and you just   need the flexibility to do that. And the third 
issue, and this is actually the most serious,   is that if you're really really obsessed about 
your mental energy budgeting and you feel like   it's super super important, I've often found 
that that's actually just an indicator that you   have overloaded yourself too much. If you need 
to distribute your energy that strategically   every single day, you're probably taking on an 
unsustainable amount of work. What I recommend,   and this is what works for me, is to have 
a very general sense of energy budgeting.   You can have deep work in times where you feel 
really effective by all means, but don't go to   the extent of overoptimizing for it. Just like 
with money, you can only get stuff by spending   it. There's no point just hoarding it for the 
sake of it. So those were the three urgency   strategies. And the final category within the high 
distractability segment is emergency restoration.   And there are two strategies in the emergency 
restorations. And you might need to use either   or both of these strategies once in a while. But 
again, if you feel the need to use this regularly,   there is definitely something going wrong. The 
first one is offline work. This means actually   disconnecting from the internet entirely in order 
to get your deep work done. So what that might   look like is going out, you know, to a retreat 
with just a pen and paper to do some writing and   thinking. And that's great. And it can create a 
a great environment for deep work. And you should   certainly do that once in a while. However, if 
you need that to do deep work and you need that   regularly, your innate level of distractability is 
at a point where it is incompatible with basically   just living in society and trying to achieve 
whatever goals you're trying to achieve. And   the second one which is very similar is a dopamine 
detox. Dopamine detox basically means again you're   basically disconnecting from all the things in 
modern society that tend to give you that quick   dopamine hit. You know like flashing lights, 
TV shows, games, uh social media, these things   that have been artificially created to produce 
an unnatural dopamine spike. Our brain is not   really good at dealing with that. And so when you 
have lots of these dopamine spikes, it creates   addiction. It reduces your attention span. And so 
every now and again, we need to just disconnect   from all of that. Let our brain just come back to 
its natural state. And I'm personally a great fan   of dopamine detoxes. And I do a dopamine detox 
like at least every single year for one or two   weeks. It's pretty much unavoidable because you're 
online, you're communicating, you're doing stuff.   You're going to get these dopamine hits whether 
you like it or not. And so everyone probably needs   a dopamine detox once in a while. The problem is 
when you feel like you need it all the time. You   come back from a dopamine detox and literally 
one or two weeks later you're back to where   you were before. What that means is that you are 
probably overexposing yourself to dopamine. And   so the dopamine detox isn't really going to help 
you here. It's like sisophus rolling the boulder   up the hill. As soon as you let go like it's just 
going to roll back down again. The problem here   is the amount of exposure you have to dopamine and 
the effect it's having on your attention span. And   so that's it. That's your toolkit for creating 
deep work. And if you enjoyed this video and   you want a similar kind of breakdown about how to
