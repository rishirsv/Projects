# Batch Import QA Checklist

This playbook walks through the scenarios that exercised the new batch import workflow. Run it against a clean `npm run dev` + `npm run server` setup to validate the end-to-end experience.

## Setup
1. Clear local storage for `watchlater-batch-import-queue`.
2. Ensure the exports directory has no residual files you care about (tests create throwaway transcripts/summaries).
3. Launch the UI and API servers in separate terminals.

## Functional Checks
- **Single-shot validation**: open the Batch Import modal and paste a mix of valid/invalid URLs. Confirm the counter, inline errors, and duplicate flags update in real time; the Import CTA remains disabled until at least one valid URL is present.
- **Queue creation**: submit three valid, unique URLs. Expect the modal to close, a success toast to appear, and the history drawer to show three dashed "Queued" cards with status pills.
- **Sequential processing**: watch the queue cards roll through "Fetching metadata" â†’ "Fetching transcript" â†’ "Generating summary" â†’ "Completed" for each video; the cards disappear and the saved summaries list inherits the new entries in order.
- **Failure and retry**: temporarily break network access (or edit `SUPADATA_API_KEY` to an invalid value) and enqueue a URL. Verify the queue card turns red, surfaces the error message, and exposes `Retry` and `Dismiss` buttons. Restore the key and retry to ensure the item succeeds.
- **Persistence**: reload the tab mid-process. Confirm queued/processing cards rehydrate with the latest stage and resume automatically.
- **Concurrency guard**: start a single URL summary and, while it is running, attempt to open the Batch Import modal or submit another single URL. The modal button should be disabled and the hero banner should warn that the batch queue is busy.
- **Stop controls**: while a batch is processing, click `Stop current` and confirm the active card flips to failed with "Stopped" text, the hero banner switches to "paused," and single-shot summaries are unblocked only after pressing `Resume`. Repeat with `Stop all` and ensure remaining queued cards fail with the stop message.
- **Watchdog recovery**: throttle or unplug the network so a batch item hangs. After ~90 seconds the queue should mark it as timed out, log the watchdog event, and keep the queue paused. Use `Retry stalled` to requeue the item and verify it processes once connectivity returns.

## Manual Edge Cases
- Paste more than ten URLs (11+) and ensure the modal blocks submission with an over-limit error.
- Include whitespace, blank lines, and clipboard noiseâ€”only real video IDs should survive dedupe.
- Queue the same video twice across sessions to confirm the second attempt is skipped with an appropriate toast.
- Trigger a Supadata or Gemini failure and inspect the console for the `[batch-import]` telemetry logs (enqueue, job-stage, job-failed/succeeded), verifying they carry useful metadata for monitoring.

Record outcome notes in the PRD task list after each run so regressions are easy to spot.

## Playwright findings (2025-09-27)

Environment: ran `npm run server` and `npm run dev`, then exercised the UI with Playwright (Chromium 140) pointed at `http://localhost:5173`.

- [pass] **Single-shot validation**: mixed URL input highlights duplicates/invalid entries, updates the counter, and keeps `Queue imports` disabled until at least one valid YouTube link is present.
- [âœ… FIXED] **Queue creation**: submitting three valid links now closes the modal, shows success toast, and surfaces the queue drawer with "Queued" cards. (Fixed in modal close issue)
- [warn] **Sequential processing**: cards never advanced past "Queued"; after ~90 s the first item flipped to "Processing timed out after 90s", pointing to missing Supadata/Gemini connectivity in this environment.
- [pass] **Failure and retry**: timed-out items render `Retry`/`Dismiss` controls and `Retry` pushes them back to `Queued`, although the bulk `Retry stalled` button remained disabled.
- [pass] **Persistence**: refreshing the page restored the queue state, hero banner, and card statuses from local storage.
- [pass] **Concurrency guard**: the single-summary `Summarize video` button stays disabled and the hero copy warns that batch processing is in progress while the queue is non-empty.
- [blocked] **Stop controls**: `Stop current` never enabled and `Stop all` had no observable effect because no job reached an active processing state.
- [warn] **Watchdog recovery**: `[batch-import] watchdog-timeout` and `job-failed` console logs fire on the timeout, but `Retry stalled` does not enable itself for the paused queue.

Manual edge cases observed this run:

- [blocked] 11+ URL over-limit: unable to revalidate while the queue is stuck in `Queued`; needs a run with working Supadata/Gemini pipeline.
- [todo] Clipboard noise dedupe, cross-session duplicate handling, and telemetry on a successful Supadata/Gemini failure path still need coverage once real API responses are available.

## Remaining Issues to Fix

### ðŸ”´ **Critical: Queue Processing Not Starting**
- **Problem**: Cards remain stuck in "Queued" state, never transition to "Fetching metadata"
- **Root Cause**: API connectivity issues (Supadata/Gemini) prevent processing from starting
- **Impact**: Batch import feature is non-functional in production

### ðŸŸ¡ **Stop Controls Not Working**
- **Problem**: `Stop current` and `Stop all` buttons have no effect
- **Impact**: Users cannot cancel stuck or unwanted batch operations

### ðŸŸ¡ **Watchdog Recovery Incomplete**
- **Problem**: `Retry stalled` button doesn't enable when queue is paused after timeout
- **Impact**: Users cannot easily recover from network/API failures

### ðŸŸ¢ **Edge Cases Need Testing**
- **Problem**: URL deduplication, over-limit validation, and telemetry logging need validation with working API pipeline
